It is valid but carries high risk and should be avoided in production unless explicitly justified."},"content":"> ⚠️ **Codex Warning**: This entry demonstrates behavior that is valid Rust but not safe or idiomatic. Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nFirst off, let's get some important caveats out of the way:\n\n* We will be using the broadest possible definition of aliasing for the sake\nof discussion. Rust's definition will probably be more restricted to factor\nin mutations and liveness.\n\n* We will be assuming a single-threaded, interrupt-free, execution. We will also\nbe ignoring things like memory-mapped hardware. Rust assumes these things\ndon't happen unless you tell it otherwise. For more details, see the\n[Concurrency Chapter](concurrency.html).\n\nWith that said, here's our working definition: variables and pointers *alias*\nif they refer to overlapping regions of memory.\n\n## Why Aliasing Matters\n\nSo why should we care about aliasing?\n\nConsider this simple function:\n\n```rust\nfn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) {\n    if *input > 10 {\n        *output = 1;\n    }\n    if *input > 5 {\n        *output *= 2;\n    }\n    // remember that `output` will be `2` if `input > 10`\n}\n```\n\nWe would *like* to be able to optimize it to the following function:\n\n```rust\nfn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) {\n    let cached_input = *input; // keep `*input` in a register\n    if cached_input > 10 {\n        // If the input is greater than 10, the previous code would set the output to 1 and then double it,\n        // resulting in an output of 2 (because `>10` implies `>5`).\n        // Here, we avoid the double assignment and just set it directly to 2.\n        *output = 2;\n    } else if cached_input > 5 {\n        *output *= 2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn Rust, this optimization should be sound. For almost any other language, it\nwouldn't be (barring global analysis). This is because the optimization relies\non knowing that aliasing doesn't occur, which most languages are fairly liberal\nwith. Specifically, we need to worry about function arguments that make `input`\nand `output` overlap, such as `compute(&x, &mut x)`.\n\nWith that input, we could get this execution:\n\n<!-- ignore: expanded code -->\n```rust,ignore\n                    //  input ==  output == 0xabad1dea\n                    // *input == *output == 20\nif *input > 10 {    // true  (*input == 20)\n    *output = 1;    // also overwrites *input, because they are the same\n}\nif *input > 5 {     // false (*input == 1)\n    *output *= 2;\n}\n                    // *input == *output == 1\n```\n\nOur optimized function would produce `*output == 2` for this input, so the\ncorrectness of our optimization relies on this input being impossible.\n\nIn Rust we know this input should be impossible because `&mut` isn't allowed to be\naliased. So we can safely reject its possibility and perform this optimization.\nIn most other languages, this input would be entirely possible, and must be considered.\n\nThis is why alias analysis is important: it lets the compiler perform useful\noptimizations! Some examples:\n\n* keeping values in registers by proving no pointers access the value's memory\n* eliminating reads by proving some memory hasn't been written to since last we read it\n* eliminating writes by proving some memory is never read before the next write to it\n* moving or reordering reads and writes by proving they don't depend on each other\n\nThese optimizations also tend to prove the soundness of bigger optimizations\nsuch as loop vectorization, constant propagation, and dead code elimination.\n\nIn the previous example, we used the fact that `&mut u32` can't be aliased to prove\nthat writes to `*output` can't possibly affect `*input`. This lets us cache `*input`\nin a register, eliminating a read.\n\nBy caching this read, we knew that the write in the `> 10` branch couldn't\naffect whether we take the `> 5` branch, allowing us to also eliminate a\nread-modify-write (doubling `*output`) when `*input > 10`.\n\nThe key thing to remember about alias analysis is that writes are the primary\nhazard for optimizations. That is, the only thing that prevents us\nfrom moving a read to any other part of the program is the possibility of us\nre-ordering it with a write to the same location.\n\nFor instance, we have no concern for aliasing in the following modified version\nof our function, because we've moved the only write to `*output` to the very\nend of our function. This allows us to freely reorder the reads of `*input` that\noccur before it:\n\n```rust\nfn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) {\n    let mut temp = *output;\n    if *input > 10 {\n        temp = 1;\n    }\n    if *input > 5 {\n        temp *= 2;\n    }\n    *output = temp;\n}\n```\n\nWe're still relying on alias analysis to assume that `input` doesn't alias\n`temp`, but the proof is much simpler: the value of a local variable can't be\naliased by things that existed before it was declared. This is an assumption\nevery language freely makes, and so this version of the function could be\noptimized the way we want in any language.\n\nThis is why the definition of \"alias\" that Rust will use likely involves some\nnotion of liveness and mutation: we don't actually care if aliasing occurs if\nthere aren't any actual writes to memory happening.\n\nOf course, a full aliasing model for Rust must also take into consideration things like\nfunction calls (which may mutate things we don't see), raw pointers (which have\nno aliasing requirements on their own), and UnsafeCell (which lets the referent\nof an `&` be mutated).","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::aliasing","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"aliasing","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["aliasing","arc_pitfalls","concurrency","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","soundness","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Aliasing","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"82694011a54b8d6c3accf8acce30a965f6d9e965c7c61e4c1b78f1d8f39fe5a4","sig":"2PNha8LF3IXWlmaKC02goPLu2aBGdjvHFLO4tGHNItHmmHSApeF4JvmDObYL8orCaDEncemmQbBTcmutJNnYDA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nRust pretty blatantly just inherits the memory model for atomics from C++20. This is not\ndue to this model being particularly excellent or easy to understand. Indeed,\nthis model is quite complex and known to have [several flaws][C11-busted].\nRather, it is a pragmatic concession to the fact that *everyone* is pretty bad\nat modeling atomics. At very least, we can benefit from existing tooling and\nresearch around the C/C++ memory model.\n(You'll often see this model referred to as \"C/C++11\" or just \"C11\". C just copies\nthe C++ memory model; and C++11 was the first version of the model but it has\nreceived some bugfixes since then.)\n\nTrying to fully explain the model in this book is fairly hopeless. It's defined\nin terms of madness-inducing causality graphs that require a full book to\nproperly understand in a practical way. If you want all the nitty-gritty\ndetails, you should check out the [C++ specification][C++-model].\nStill, we'll try to cover the basics and some of the problems Rust developers\nface.\n\nThe C++ memory model is fundamentally about trying to bridge the gap between the\nsemantics we want, the optimizations compilers want, and the inconsistent chaos\nour hardware wants. *We* would like to just write programs and have them do\nexactly what we said but, you know, fast. Wouldn't that be great?\n\n## Compiler Reordering\n\nCompilers fundamentally want to be able to do all sorts of complicated\ntransformations to reduce data dependencies and eliminate dead code. In\nparticular, they may radically change the actual order of events, or make events\nnever occur! If we write something like:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nx = 1;\ny = 3;\nx = 2;\n```\n\nThe compiler may conclude that it would be best if your program did:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nx = 2;\ny = 3;\n```\n\nThis has inverted the order of events and completely eliminated one event.\nFrom a single-threaded perspective this is completely unobservable: after all\nthe statements have executed we are in exactly the same state. But if our\nprogram is multi-threaded, we may have been relying on `x` to actually be\nassigned to 1 before `y` was assigned. We would like the compiler to be\nable to make these kinds of optimizations, because they can seriously improve\nperformance. On the other hand, we'd also like to be able to depend on our\nprogram *doing the thing we said*.\n\n## Hardware Reordering\n\nOn the other hand, even if the compiler totally understood what we wanted and\nrespected our wishes, our hardware might instead get us in trouble. Trouble\ncomes from CPUs in the form of memory hierarchies. There is indeed a global\nshared memory space somewhere in your hardware, but from the perspective of each\nCPU core it is *so very far away* and *so very slow*. Each CPU would rather work\nwith its local cache of the data and only go through all the anguish of\ntalking to shared memory only when it doesn't actually have that memory in\ncache.\n\nAfter all, that's the whole point of the cache, right? If every read from the\ncache had to run back to shared memory to double check that it hadn't changed,\nwhat would the point be? The end result is that the hardware doesn't guarantee\nthat events that occur in some order on *one* thread, occur in the same\norder on *another* thread. To guarantee this, we must issue special instructions\nto the CPU telling it to be a bit less smart.\n\nFor instance, say we convince the compiler to emit this logic:\n\n```text\ninitial state: x = 0, y = 1\n\nTHREAD 1        THREAD 2\ny = 3;          if x == 1 {\nx = 1;              y *= 2;\n                }\n```\n\nIdeally this program has 2 possible final states:\n\n* `y = 3`: (thread 2 did the check before thread 1 completed)\n* `y = 6`: (thread 2 did the check after thread 1 completed)\n\nHowever there's a third potential state that the hardware enables:\n\n* `y = 2`: (thread 2 saw `x = 1`, but not `y = 3`, and then overwrote `y = 3`)\n\nIt's worth noting that different kinds of CPU provide different guarantees. It\nis common to separate hardware into two categories: strongly-ordered and weakly-ordered.\nMost notably x86/64 provides strong ordering guarantees, while ARM\nprovides weak ordering guarantees. This has two consequences for concurrent\nprogramming:\n\n* Asking for stronger guarantees on strongly-ordered hardware may be cheap or\n  even free because they already provide strong guarantees unconditionally.\n  Weaker guarantees may only yield performance wins on weakly-ordered hardware.\n\n* Asking for guarantees that are too weak on strongly-ordered hardware is\n  more likely to *happen* to work, even though your program is strictly\n  incorrect. If possible, concurrent algorithms should be tested on\n  weakly-ordered hardware.\n\n## Data Accesses\n\nThe C++ memory model attempts to bridge the gap by allowing us to talk about the\n*causality* of our program. Generally, this is by establishing a *happens\nbefore* relationship between parts of the program and the threads that are\nrunning them. This gives the hardware and compiler room to optimize the program\nmore aggressively where a strict happens-before relationship isn't established,\nbut forces them to be more careful where one is established. The way we\ncommunicate these relationships are through *data accesses* and *atomic\naccesses*.\n\nData accesses are the bread-and-butter of the programming world. They are\nfundamentally unsynchronized and compilers are free to aggressively optimize\nthem. In particular, data accesses are free to be reordered by the compiler on\nthe assumption that the program is single-threaded. The hardware is also free to\npropagate the changes made in data accesses to other threads as lazily and\ninconsistently as it wants. Most critically, data accesses are how data races\nhappen. Data accesses are very friendly to the hardware and compiler, but as\nwe've seen they offer *awful* semantics to try to write synchronized code with.\nActually, that's too weak.\n\n**It is literally impossible to write correct synchronized code using only data\naccesses.**\n\nAtomic accesses are how we tell the hardware and compiler that our program is\nmulti-threaded. Each atomic access can be marked with an *ordering* that\nspecifies what kind of relationship it establishes with other accesses. In\npractice, this boils down to telling the compiler and hardware certain things\nthey *can't* do. For the compiler, this largely revolves around re-ordering of\ninstructions. For the hardware, this largely revolves around how writes are\npropagated to other threads. The set of orderings Rust exposes are:\n\n* Sequentially Consistent (SeqCst)\n* Release\n* Acquire\n* Relaxed\n\n(Note: We explicitly do not expose the C++ *consume* ordering)\n\nTODO: negative reasoning vs positive reasoning? TODO: \"can't forget to\nsynchronize\"\n\n## Sequentially Consistent\n\nSequentially Consistent is the most powerful of all, implying the restrictions\nof all other orderings. Intuitively, a sequentially consistent operation\ncannot be reordered: all accesses on one thread that happen before and after a\nSeqCst access stay before and after it. A data-race-free program that uses\nonly sequentially consistent atomics and data accesses has the very nice\nproperty that there is a single global execution of the program's instructions\nthat all threads agree on. This execution is also particularly nice to reason\nabout: it's just an interleaving of each thread's individual executions. This\ndoes not hold if you start using the weaker atomic orderings.\n\nThe relative developer-friendliness of sequential consistency doesn't come for\nfree. Even on strongly-ordered platforms sequential consistency involves\nemitting memory fences.\n\nIn practice, sequential consistency is rarely necessary for program correctness.\nHowever sequential consistency is definitely the right choice if you're not\nconfident about the other memory orders. Having your program run a bit slower\nthan it needs to is certainly better than it running incorrectly! It's also\nmechanically trivial to downgrade atomic operations to have a weaker\nconsistency later on. Just change `SeqCst` to `Relaxed` and you're done! Of\ncourse, proving that this transformation is *correct* is a whole other matter.\n\n## Acquire-Release\n\nAcquire and Release are largely intended to be paired. Their names hint at their\nuse case: they're perfectly suited for acquiring and releasing locks, and\nensuring that critical sections don't overlap.\n\nIntuitively, an acquire access ensures that every access after it stays after\nit. However operations that occur before an acquire are free to be reordered to\noccur after it. Similarly, a release access ensures that every access before it\nstays before it. However operations that occur after a release are free to be\nreordered to occur before it.\n\nWhen thread A releases a location in memory and then thread B subsequently\nacquires *the same* location in memory, causality is established. Every write\n(including non-atomic and relaxed atomic writes) that happened before A's\nrelease will be observed by B after its acquisition. However no causality is\nestablished with any other threads. Similarly, no causality is established\nif A and B access *different* locations in memory.\n\nBasic use of release-acquire is therefore simple: you acquire a location of\nmemory to begin the critical section, and then release that location to end it.\nFor instance, a simple spinlock might look like:\n\n```rust\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\nuse std::thread;\n\nfn main() {\n    let lock = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false)); // value answers \"am I locked?\"\n\n    // ... distribute lock to threads somehow ...\n\n    // Try to acquire the lock by setting it to true\n    while lock.compare_and_swap(false, true, Ordering::Acquire) { }\n    // broke out of the loop, so we successfully acquired the lock!\n\n    // ... scary data accesses ...\n\n    // ok we're done, release the lock\n    lock.store(false, Ordering::Release);\n}\n```\n\nOn strongly-ordered platforms most accesses have release or acquire semantics,\nmaking release and acquire often totally free. This is not the case on\nweakly-ordered platforms.\n\n## Relaxed\n\nRelaxed accesses are the absolute weakest. They can be freely re-ordered and\nprovide no happens-before relationship. Still, relaxed operations are still\natomic. That is, they don't count as data accesses and any read-modify-write\noperations done to them occur atomically. Relaxed operations are appropriate for\nthings that you definitely want to happen, but don't particularly otherwise care\nabout. For instance, incrementing a counter can be safely done by multiple\nthreads using a relaxed `fetch_add` if you're not using the counter to\nsynchronize any other accesses.\n\nThere's rarely a benefit in making an operation relaxed on strongly-ordered\nplatforms, since they usually provide release-acquire semantics anyway. However\nrelaxed operations can be cheaper on weakly-ordered platforms.\n\n[C11-busted]: http://plv.mpi-sws.org/c11comp/popl15.pdf\n[C++-model]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::atomics","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"atomics","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Atomics","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"d1b9a7ae31537db0ea3bad8dc1e3564b18c850d56dbf989a056e42f67156e830","sig":"9m2wLw+Kx3ZEhO790X/jEpUMBhYZ3jnFOPtSfKL00rd+BT0rnqqrFCFaFV1CnUNv4e1OGAYz0l0v0oDXLExMBg==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

For example, `main`, `_start`, `WinMain`, or whatever starting point is relevant for your target.\nAdditionally, you need to use the `#![no_main]` attribute to prevent the compiler from attempting to generate an entry point itself.\n\nAdditionally, it's required to define a [panic handler function](panic-handler.html).\n\n```rust\n#![feature(lang_items, core_intrinsics, rustc_private)]\n#![allow(internal_features)]\n#![no_std]\n#![no_main]\n\n// Necessary for `panic = \"unwind\"` builds on cfg(unix) platforms.\n#![feature(panic_unwind)]\nextern crate unwind;\n\n// Pull in the system libc library for what crt0.o likely requires.\n#[cfg(not(windows))]\nextern crate libc;\n\nuse core::ffi::{c_char, c_int};\nuse core::panic::PanicInfo;\n\n// Entry point for this program.\n#[unsafe(no_mangle)] // ensure that this symbol is included in the output as `main`\nextern \"C\" fn main(_argc: c_int, _argv: *const *const c_char) -> c_int {\n    0\n}\n\n// These functions are used by the compiler, but not for an empty program like this.\n// They are normally provided by `std`.\n#[lang = \"eh_personality\"]\nfn rust_eh_personality() {}\n#[panic_handler]\nfn panic_handler(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! { core::intrinsics::abort() }\n```\n\nIf you are working with a target that doesn't have binary releases of the\nstandard library available via rustup (this probably means you are building the\n`core` crate yourself) and need compiler-rt intrinsics (i.e. you are probably\ngetting linker errors when building an executable:\n``undefined reference to `__aeabi_memcpy'``), you need to manually link to the\n[`compiler_builtins` crate] to get those intrinsics and solve the linker errors.\n\n[`compiler_builtins` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/compiler_builtins\n[lang item]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/lang-items.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::beneath-std","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"beneath-std","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","panic","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Beneath `std`","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"4c4472a05a102575f0ba0bd5ac1652b9fbae1b93ee43b2af5113c9e65b240584","sig":"GgV1Ohuppm/4ANlccpOTVtD0087k+Zw/fgKvJKXbFk6bmLZ7Ga8XFE/E+wkUp/I4IG+gz6MlSJMQRDcbMZBuDg==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nThe mutual exclusion property of mutable references can be very limiting when\nworking with a composite structure. The borrow checker (a.k.a. borrowck)\nunderstands some basic stuff, but will fall over pretty easily. It does\nunderstand structs sufficiently to know that it's possible to borrow disjoint\nfields of a struct simultaneously. So this works today:\n\n```rust\nstruct Foo {\n    a: i32,\n    b: i32,\n    c: i32,\n}\n\nlet mut x = Foo {a: 0, b: 0, c: 0};\nlet a = &mut x.a;\nlet b = &mut x.b;\nlet c = &x.c;\n*b += 1;\nlet c2 = &x.c;\n*a += 10;\nprintln!(\"{} {} {} {}\", a, b, c, c2);\n```\n\nHowever borrowck doesn't understand arrays or slices in any way, so this doesn't\nwork:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nlet mut x = [1, 2, 3];\nlet a = &mut x[0];\nlet b = &mut x[1];\nprintln!(\"{} {}\", a, b);\n```\n\n```text\nerror[E0499]: cannot borrow `x[..]` as mutable more than once at a time\n --> src/lib.rs:4:18\n  |\n3 |     let a = &mut x[0];\n  |                  ---- first mutable borrow occurs here\n4 |     let b = &mut x[1];\n  |                  ^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here\n5 |     println!(\"{} {}\", a, b);\n6 | }\n  | - first borrow ends here\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nWhile it was plausible that borrowck could understand this simple case, it's\npretty clearly hopeless for borrowck to understand disjointness in general\ncontainer types like a tree, especially if distinct keys actually *do* map\nto the same value.\n\nIn order to \"teach\" borrowck that what we're doing is ok, we need to drop down\nto unsafe code. For instance, mutable slices expose a `split_at_mut` function\nthat consumes the slice and returns two mutable slices. One for everything to\nthe left of the index, and one for everything to the right. Intuitively we know\nthis is safe because the slices don't overlap, and therefore alias. However\nthe implementation requires some unsafety:\n\n```rust\n# use std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut;\n# struct FakeSlice<T>(T);\n# impl<T> FakeSlice<T> {\n# fn len(&self) -> usize { unimplemented!() }\n# fn as_mut_ptr(&mut self) -> *mut T { unimplemented!() }\npub fn split_at_mut(&mut self, mid: usize) -> (&mut [T], &mut [T]) {\n    let len = self.len();\n    let ptr = self.as_mut_ptr();\n\n    unsafe {\n        assert!(mid <= len);\n\n        (from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),\n         from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid))\n    }\n}\n# }\n```\n\nThis is actually a bit subtle. So as to avoid ever making two `&mut`'s to the\nsame value, we explicitly construct brand-new slices through raw pointers.\n\nHowever more subtle is how iterators that yield mutable references work.\nThe iterator trait is defined as follows:\n\n```rust\ntrait Iterator {\n    type Item;\n\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;\n}\n```\n\nGiven this definition, Self::Item has *no* connection to `self`. This means that\nwe can call `next` several times in a row, and hold onto all the results\n*concurrently*. This is perfectly fine for by-value iterators, which have\nexactly these semantics. It's also actually fine for shared references, as they\nadmit arbitrarily many references to the same thing (although the iterator needs\nto be a separate object from the thing being shared).\n\nBut mutable references make this a mess. At first glance, they might seem\ncompletely incompatible with this API, as it would produce multiple mutable\nreferences to the same object!\n\nHowever it actually *does* work, exactly because iterators are one-shot objects.\nEverything an IterMut yields will be yielded at most once, so we don't\nactually ever yield multiple mutable references to the same piece of data.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, mutable iterators don't require unsafe code to be\nimplemented for many types!\n\nFor instance here's a singly linked list:\n\n```rust\n# fn main() {}\ntype Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;\n\nstruct Node<T> {\n    elem: T,\n    next: Link<T>,\n}\n\npub struct LinkedList<T> {\n    head: Link<T>,\n}\n\npub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(Option<&'a mut Node<T>>);\n\nimpl<T> LinkedList<T> {\n    fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<T> {\n        IterMut(self.head.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node))\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {\n    type Item = &'a mut T;\n\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        self.0.take().map(|node| {\n            self.0 = node.next.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node);\n            &mut node.elem\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's a mutable slice:\n\n```rust\n# fn main() {}\nuse std::mem;\n\npub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(&'a mut[T]);\n\nimpl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {\n    type Item = &'a mut T;\n\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        let slice = mem::take(&mut self.0);\n        if slice.is_empty() { return None; }\n\n        let (l, r) = slice.split_at_mut(1);\n        self.0 = r;\n        l.get_mut(0)\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for IterMut<'a, T> {\n    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        let slice = mem::take(&mut self.0);\n        if slice.is_empty() { return None; }\n\n        let new_len = slice.len() - 1;\n        let (l, r) = slice.split_at_mut(new_len);\n        self.0 = l;\n        r.get_mut(0)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's a binary tree:\n\n```rust\n# fn main() {}\nuse std::collections::VecDeque;\n\ntype Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;\n\nstruct Node<T> {\n    elem: T,\n    left: Link<T>,\n    right: Link<T>,\n}\n\npub struct Tree<T> {\n    root: Link<T>,\n}\n\nstruct NodeIterMut<'a, T: 'a> {\n    elem: Option<&'a mut T>,\n    left: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,\n    right: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,\n}\n\nenum State<'a, T: 'a> {\n    Elem(&'a mut T),\n    Node(&'a mut Node<T>),\n}\n\npub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(VecDeque<NodeIterMut<'a, T>>);\n\nimpl<T> Tree<T> {\n    pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<T> {\n        let mut deque = VecDeque::new();\n        self.root.as_mut().map(|root| deque.push_front(root.iter_mut()));\n        IterMut(deque)\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T> Node<T> {\n    pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> NodeIterMut<T> {\n        NodeIterMut {\n            elem: Some(&mut self.elem),\n            left: self.left.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node),\n            right: self.right.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nimpl<'a, T> Iterator for NodeIterMut<'a, T> {\n    type Item = State<'a, T>;\n\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        match self.left.take() {\n            Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)),\n            None => match self.elem.take() {\n                Some(elem) => Some(State::Elem(elem)),\n                None => match self.right.take() {\n                    Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)),\n                    None => None,\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for NodeIterMut<'a, T> {\n    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        match self.right.take() {\n            Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)),\n            None => match self.elem.take() {\n                Some(elem) => Some(State::Elem(elem)),\n                None => match self.left.take() {\n                    Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)),\n                    None => None,\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> {\n    type Item = &'a mut T;\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        loop {\n            match self.0.front_mut().and_then(|node_it| node_it.next()) {\n                Some(State::Elem(elem)) => return Some(elem),\n                Some(State::Node(node)) => self.0.push_front(node.iter_mut()),\n                None => if let None = self.0.pop_front() { return None },\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for IterMut<'a, T> {\n    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n        loop {\n            match self.0.back_mut().and_then(|node_it| node_it.next_back()) {\n                Some(State::Elem(elem)) => return Some(elem),\n                Some(State::Node(node)) => self.0.push_back(node.iter_mut()),\n                None => if let None = self.0.pop_back() { return None },\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAll of these are completely safe and work on stable Rust!

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nLike C, all stack variables in Rust are uninitialized until a value is\nexplicitly assigned to them. Unlike C, Rust statically prevents you from ever\nreading them until you do:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nfn main() {\n    let x: i32;\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n}\n```\n\n```text\n  |\n3 |     println!(\"{}\", x);\n  |                    ^ use of possibly uninitialized `x`\n```\n\nThis is based off of a basic branch analysis: every branch must assign a value\nto `x` before it is first used. For short, we also say that \"`x` is init\" or\n\"`x` is uninit\".\n\nInterestingly, Rust doesn't require the variable\nto be mutable to perform a delayed initialization if every branch assigns\nexactly once. However the analysis does not take advantage of constant analysis\nor anything like that. So this compiles:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x: i32;\n\n    if true {\n        x = 1;\n    } else {\n        x = 2;\n    }\n\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n}\n```\n\nbut this doesn't:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nfn main() {\n    let x: i32;\n    if true {\n        x = 1;\n    }\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n}\n```\n\n```text\n  |\n6 |     println!(\"{}\", x);\n  |                    ^ use of possibly uninitialized `x`\n```\n\nwhile this does:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x: i32;\n    if true {\n        x = 1;\n        println!(\"{}\", x);\n    }\n    // Don't care that there are branches where it's not initialized\n    // since we don't use the value in those branches\n}\n```\n\nOf course, while the analysis doesn't consider actual values, it does\nhave a relatively sophisticated understanding of dependencies and control\nflow. For instance, this works:\n\n```rust\nlet x: i32;\n\nloop {\n    // Rust doesn't understand that this branch will be taken unconditionally,\n    // because it relies on actual values.\n    if true {\n        // But it does understand that it will only be taken once because\n        // we unconditionally break out of it. Therefore `x` doesn't\n        // need to be marked as mutable.\n        x = 0;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n// It also knows that it's impossible to get here without reaching the break.\n// And therefore that `x` must be initialized here!\nprintln!(\"{}\", x);\n```\n\nIf a value is moved out of a variable, that variable becomes logically\nuninitialized if the type of the value isn't Copy. That is:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = 0;\n    let y = Box::new(0);\n    let z1 = x; // x is still valid because i32 is Copy\n    let z2 = y; // y is now logically uninitialized because Box isn't Copy\n}\n```\n\nHowever reassigning `y` in this example *would* require `y` to be marked as\nmutable, as a Safe Rust program could observe that the value of `y` changed:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut y = Box::new(0);\n    let z = y; // y is now logically uninitialized because Box isn't Copy\n    y = Box::new(1); // reinitialize y\n}\n```\n\nOtherwise it's like `y` is a brand new variable.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::checked-uninit","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"checked-uninit","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Checked Uninitialized Memory","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"ba5541c0cc6e0e438fec4e21ad6d6110b247c262f663bf5afb9ee5fcaaf49d0f","sig":"2nlMeCEjbIOwLY2iwkSd0VZfsHBnREa9GtJhS8tqMXACVIH2eM3ZiGTtWg0Xmyr+WSml+4Qqs3rtNOXopAsaDQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nThere is exactly one way to create an instance of a user-defined type: name it,\nand initialize all its fields at once:\n\n```rust\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: bool,\n}\n\nenum Bar {\n    X(u32),\n    Y(bool),\n}\n\nstruct Unit;\n\nlet foo = Foo { a: 0, b: 1, c: false };\nlet bar = Bar::X(0);\nlet empty = Unit;\n```\n\nThat's it. Every other way you make an instance of a type is just calling a\ntotally vanilla function that does some stuff and eventually bottoms out to The\nOne True Constructor.\n\nUnlike C++, Rust does not come with a slew of built-in kinds of constructor.\nThere are no Copy, Default, Assignment, Move, or whatever constructors. The\nreasons for this are varied, but it largely boils down to Rust's philosophy of\n*being explicit*.\n\nMove constructors are meaningless in Rust because we don't enable types to\n\"care\" about their location in memory. Every type must be ready for it to be\nblindly memcopied to somewhere else in memory. This means pure on-the-stack-but-\nstill-movable intrusive linked lists are simply not happening in Rust (safely).\n\nAssignment and copy constructors similarly don't exist because move semantics\nare the only semantics in Rust. At most `x = y` just moves the bits of y into\nthe x variable. Rust does provide two facilities for providing C++'s copy-\noriented semantics: `Copy` and `Clone`. Clone is our moral equivalent of a copy\nconstructor, but it's never implicitly invoked. You have to explicitly call\n`clone` on an element you want to be cloned. Copy is a special case of Clone\nwhere the implementation is just \"copy the bits\". Copy types *are* implicitly\ncloned whenever they're moved, but because of the definition of Copy this just\nmeans not treating the old copy as uninitialized -- a no-op.\n\nWhile Rust provides a `Default` trait for specifying the moral equivalent of a\ndefault constructor, it's incredibly rare for this trait to be used. This is\nbecause variables [aren't implicitly initialized][uninit]. Default is basically\nonly useful for generic programming. In concrete contexts, a type will provide a\nstatic `new` method for any kind of \"default\" constructor. This has no relation\nto `new` in other languages and has no special meaning. It's just a naming\nconvention.\n\nTODO: talk about \"placement new\"?\n\n[uninit]: uninitialized.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::constructors","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"constructors","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Constructors","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"5a39a8c026eeee0e112f99de3c4a0f373f77c8c12322f0849c5279c1ee2d93c6","sig":"ksxCIDHORiWX5YaTrvQ1NpdmqYmFz1/5k+j9dUsijVYH5bqfqR6FIG8Z+KLiMts4o67rTeP27lesMus39b7pCA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nAt the end of the day, everything is just a pile of bits somewhere, and type\nsystems are just there to help us use those bits right. There are two common\nproblems with typing bits: needing to reinterpret those exact bits as a\ndifferent type, and needing to change the bits to have equivalent meaning for\na different type. Because Rust encourages encoding important properties in the\ntype system, these problems are incredibly pervasive. As such, Rust\nconsequently gives you several ways to solve them.\n\nFirst we'll look at the ways that Safe Rust gives you to reinterpret values.\nThe most trivial way to do this is to just destructure a value into its\nconstituent parts and then build a new type out of them. e.g.\n\n```rust\nstruct Foo {\n    x: u32,\n    y: u16,\n}\n\nstruct Bar {\n    a: u32,\n    b: u16,\n}\n\nfn reinterpret(foo: Foo) -> Bar {\n    let Foo { x, y } = foo;\n    Bar { a: x, b: y }\n}\n```\n\nBut this is, at best, annoying. For common conversions, Rust provides\nmore ergonomic alternatives.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::conversions","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"conversions","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Type Conversions","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"fa0d8da0590b3ed105c18c10952db5b7ed7742759910a43d45e9a2634486cbfb","sig":"D2oS+dJIflMI3HfVQcDLuKmmUQrUTIMVe/Tw2ullmWBVktJBys/GgdLYBeUR5pcjBc518xT5iVOUcmFbaE+TCA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nWhat the language *does* provide is full-blown automatic destructors through the\n`Drop` trait, which provides the following method:\n\n<!-- ignore: function header -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn drop(&mut self);\n```\n\nThis method gives the type time to somehow finish what it was doing.\n\n**After `drop` is run, Rust will recursively try to drop all of the fields\nof `self`.**\n\nThis is a convenience feature so that you don't have to write \"destructor\nboilerplate\" to drop children. If a struct has no special logic for being\ndropped other than dropping its children, then it means `Drop` doesn't need to\nbe implemented at all!\n\n**There is no stable way to prevent this behavior in Rust 1.0.**\n\nNote that taking `&mut self` means that even if you could suppress recursive\nDrop, Rust will prevent you from e.g. moving fields out of self. For most types,\nthis is totally fine.\n\nFor instance, a custom implementation of `Box` might write `Drop` like this:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(ptr_internals, allocator_api)]\n\nuse std::alloc::{Allocator, Global, GlobalAlloc, Layout};\nuse std::mem;\nuse std::ptr::{drop_in_place, NonNull, Unique};\n\nstruct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> }\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Box<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr());\n            let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into();\n            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>())\n        }\n    }\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nand this works fine because when Rust goes to drop the `ptr` field it just sees\na [Unique] that has no actual `Drop` implementation. Similarly nothing can\nuse-after-free the `ptr` because when drop exits, it becomes inaccessible.\n\nHowever this wouldn't work:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(allocator_api, ptr_internals)]\n\nuse std::alloc::{Allocator, Global, GlobalAlloc, Layout};\nuse std::ptr::{drop_in_place, Unique, NonNull};\nuse std::mem;\n\nstruct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> }\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Box<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr());\n            let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into();\n            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct SuperBox<T> { my_box: Box<T> }\n\nimpl<T> Drop for SuperBox<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            // Hyper-optimized: deallocate the box's contents for it\n            // without `drop`ing the contents\n            let c: NonNull<T> = self.my_box.ptr.into();\n            Global.deallocate(c.cast::<u8>(), Layout::new::<T>());\n        }\n    }\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nAfter we deallocate the `box`'s ptr in SuperBox's destructor, Rust will\nhappily proceed to tell the box to Drop itself and everything will blow up with\nuse-after-frees and double-frees.\n\nNote that the recursive drop behavior applies to all structs and enums\nregardless of whether they implement Drop. Therefore something like\n\n```rust\nstruct Boxy<T> {\n    data1: Box<T>,\n    data2: Box<T>,\n    info: u32,\n}\n```\n\nwill have the destructors of its `data1` and `data2` fields called whenever it \"would\" be\ndropped, even though it itself doesn't implement Drop. We say that such a type\n*needs Drop*, even though it is not itself Drop.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n```rust\nenum Link {\n    Next(Box<Link>),\n    None,\n}\n```\n\nwill have its inner Box field dropped if and only if an instance stores the\nNext variant.\n\nIn general this works really nicely because you don't need to worry about\nadding/removing drops when you refactor your data layout. Still there's\ncertainly many valid use cases for needing to do trickier things with\ndestructors.\n\nThe classic safe solution to overriding recursive drop and allowing moving out\nof Self during `drop` is to use an Option:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(allocator_api, ptr_internals)]\n\nuse std::alloc::{Allocator, GlobalAlloc, Global, Layout};\nuse std::ptr::{drop_in_place, Unique, NonNull};\nuse std::mem;\n\nstruct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> }\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Box<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr());\n            let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into();\n            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct SuperBox<T> { my_box: Option<Box<T>> }\n\nimpl<T> Drop for SuperBox<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            // Hyper-optimized: deallocate the box's contents for it\n            // without `drop`ing the contents. Need to set the `box`\n            // field as `None` to prevent Rust from trying to Drop it.\n            let my_box = self.my_box.take().unwrap();\n            let c: NonNull<T> = my_box.ptr.into();\n            Global.deallocate(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>());\n            mem::forget(my_box);\n        }\n    }\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nHowever this has fairly odd semantics: you are saying that a field that *should*\nalways be Some *may* be None, just because of what happens in the destructor. Of\ncourse this conversely makes a lot of sense: you can call arbitrary methods on\nself during the destructor, and this should prevent you from ever doing so after\ndeinitializing the field. Not that it will prevent you from producing any other\narbitrarily invalid state in there.\n\nOn balance this is an ok choice. Certainly what you should reach for by default.\nHowever, in the future we expect there to be a first-class way to announce that\na field shouldn't be automatically dropped.\n\n[Unique]: phantom-data.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::destructors","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"destructors","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Destructors","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"6db577ebbceb07d8dbbff8da17cdd7a8ccd52b56ee8105654ad9ec48b6e853d7","sig":"+YenoxIrQpXo66eiO3XK4pKBhMTVaTDp0ntwkrvgZNlh1vSCZmcJbDoWiPaugQo0oiaMVn8MQuF24TrCGgiQAA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nThe dot operator will perform a lot of magic to convert types.\nIt will perform auto-referencing, auto-dereferencing, and coercion until types\nmatch.\nThe detailed mechanics of method lookup are defined [here][method_lookup],\nbut here is a brief overview that outlines the main steps.\n\nSuppose we have a function `foo` that has a receiver (a `self`, `&self` or\n`&mut self` parameter).\nIf we call `value.foo()`, the compiler needs to determine what type `Self` is before\nit can call the correct implementation of the function.\nFor this example, we will say that `value` has type `T`.\n\nWe will use [fully-qualified syntax][fqs] to be more clear about exactly which\ntype we are calling a function on.\n\n- First, the compiler checks if it can call `T::foo(value)` directly.\nThis is called a \"by value\" method call.\n- If it can't call this function (for example, if the function has the wrong type\nor a trait isn't implemented for `Self`), then the compiler tries to add in an\nautomatic reference.\nThis means that the compiler tries `<&T>::foo(value)` and `<&mut T>::foo(value)`.\nThis is called an \"autoref\" method call.\n- If none of these candidates worked, it dereferences `T` and tries again.\nThis uses the `Deref` trait - if `T: Deref<Target = U>` then it tries again with\ntype `U` instead of `T`.\nIf it can't dereference `T`, it can also try _unsizing_ `T`.\nThis just means that if `T` has a size parameter known at compile time, it \"forgets\"\nit for the purpose of resolving methods.\nFor instance, this unsizing step can convert `[i32; 2]` into `[i32]` by \"forgetting\"\nthe size of the array.\n\nHere is an example of the method lookup algorithm:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet array: Rc<Box<[T; 3]>> = ...;\nlet first_entry = array[0];\n```\n\nHow does the compiler actually compute `array[0]` when the array is behind so\nmany indirections?\nFirst, `array[0]` is really just syntax sugar for the [`Index`][index] trait -\nthe compiler will convert `array[0]` into `array.index(0)`.\nNow, the compiler checks to see if `array` implements `Index`, so that it can call\nthe function.\n\nThen, the compiler checks if `Rc<Box<[T; 3]>>` implements `Index`, but it\ndoes not, and neither do `&Rc<Box<[T; 3]>>` or `&mut Rc<Box<[T; 3]>>`.\nSince none of these worked, the compiler dereferences the `Rc<Box<[T; 3]>>` into\n`Box<[T; 3]>` and tries again.\n`Box<[T; 3]>`, `&Box<[T; 3]>`, and `&mut Box<[T; 3]>` do not implement `Index`,\nso it dereferences again.\n`[T; 3]` and its autorefs also do not implement `Index`.\nIt can't dereference `[T; 3]`, so the compiler unsizes it, giving `[T]`.\nFinally, `[T]` implements `Index`, so it can now call the actual `index` function.\n\nConsider the following more complicated example of the dot operator at work:\n\n```rust\nfn do_stuff<T: Clone>(value: &T) {\n    let cloned = value.clone();\n}\n```\n\nWhat type is `cloned`?\nFirst, the compiler checks if it can call by value.\nThe type of `value` is `&T`, and so the `clone` function has signature\n`fn clone(&T) -> T`.\nIt knows that `T: Clone`, so the compiler finds that `cloned: T`.\n\nWhat would happen if the `T: Clone` restriction was removed? It would not be able\nto call by value, since there is no implementation of `Clone` for `T`.\nSo the compiler tries to call by autoref.\nIn this case, the function has the signature `fn clone(&&T) -> &T` since\n`Self = &T`.\nThe compiler sees that `&T: Clone`, and then deduces that `cloned: &T`.\n\nHere is another example where the autoref behavior is used to create some subtle\neffects:\n\n```rust\n# use std::sync::Arc;\n#\n#[derive(Clone)]\nstruct Container<T>(Arc<T>);\n\nfn clone_containers<T>(foo: &Container<i32>, bar: &Container<T>) {\n    let foo_cloned = foo.clone();\n    let bar_cloned = bar.clone();\n}\n```\n\nWhat types are `foo_cloned` and `bar_cloned`?\nWe know that `Container<i32>: Clone`, so the compiler calls `clone` by value to give\n`foo_cloned: Container<i32>`.\nHowever, `bar_cloned` actually has type `&Container<T>`.\nSurely this doesn't make sense - we added `#[derive(Clone)]` to `Container`, so it\nmust implement `Clone`!\nLooking closer, the code generated by the `derive` macro is (roughly):\n\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Clone for Container<T> where T: Clone {\n    fn clone(&self) -> Self {\n        Self(Arc::clone(&self.0))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe derived `Clone` implementation is [only defined where `T: Clone`][clone],\nso there is no implementation for `Container<T>: Clone` for a generic `T`.\nThe compiler then looks to see if `&Container<T>` implements `Clone`, which it does.\nSo it deduces that `clone` is called by autoref, and so `bar_cloned` has type\n`&Container<T>`.\n\nWe can fix this by implementing `Clone` manually without requiring `T: Clone`:\n\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Clone for Container<T> {\n    fn clone(&self) -> Self {\n        Self(Arc::clone(&self.0))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, the type checker deduces that `bar_cloned: Container<T>`.\n\n[fqs]: ../book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#fully-qualified-syntax-for-disambiguation-calling-methods-with-the-same-name\n[method_lookup]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/method-lookup.html\n[index]: ../std/ops/trait.Index.html\n[clone]: ../std/clone/trait.Clone.html#derivable","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::dot-operator","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"dot-operator","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","type_coercion","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"The Dot Operator","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"ef4da8f4b5da55fb5db34ab3f167debe1c5d2ce0c7d3ac6d6f2e72969d87e69c","sig":"I9oY6sDd0hH/dVChSk++acmRLFuzQq9faqcVSmoPvRw2hpUy1nL71HdJgj5xUqxLOZbwlfFpeXCW0XRlMP7oAQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nThe examples in the previous section introduce an interesting problem for Rust.\nWe have seen that it's possible to conditionally initialize, deinitialize, and\nreinitialize locations of memory totally safely. For Copy types, this isn't\nparticularly notable since they're just a random pile of bits. However types\nwith destructors are a different story: Rust needs to know whether to call a\ndestructor whenever a variable is assigned to, or a variable goes out of scope.\nHow can it do this with conditional initialization?\n\nNote that this is not a problem that all assignments need worry about. In\nparticular, assigning through a dereference unconditionally drops, and assigning\nin a `let` unconditionally doesn't drop:\n\n```rust\nlet mut x = Box::new(0); // let makes a fresh variable, so never need to drop\nlet y = &mut x;\n*y = Box::new(1); // Deref assumes the referent is initialized, so always drops\n```\n\nThis is only a problem when overwriting a previously initialized variable or\none of its subfields.\n\nIt turns out that Rust actually tracks whether a type should be dropped or not\n*at runtime*. As a variable becomes initialized and uninitialized, a *drop flag*\nfor that variable is toggled. When a variable might need to be dropped, this\nflag is evaluated to determine if it should be dropped.\n\nOf course, it is often the case that a value's initialization state can be\nstatically known at every point in the program. If this is the case, then the\ncompiler can theoretically generate more efficient code! For instance, straight-\nline code has such *static drop semantics*:\n\n```rust\nlet mut x = Box::new(0); // x was uninit; just overwrite.\nlet mut y = x;           // y was uninit; just overwrite and make x uninit.\nx = Box::new(0);         // x was uninit; just overwrite.\ny = x;                   // y was init; Drop y, overwrite it, and make x uninit!\n                         // y goes out of scope; y was init; Drop y!\n                         // x goes out of scope; x was uninit; do nothing.\n```\n\nSimilarly, branched code where all branches have the same behavior with respect\nto initialization has static drop semantics:\n\n```rust\n# let condition = true;\nlet mut x = Box::new(0);    // x was uninit; just overwrite.\nif condition {\n    drop(x)                 // x gets moved out; make x uninit.\n} else {\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n    drop(x)                 // x gets moved out; make x uninit.\n}\nx = Box::new(0);            // x was uninit; just overwrite.\n                            // x goes out of scope; x was init; Drop x!\n```\n\nHowever code like this *requires* runtime information to correctly Drop:\n\n```rust\n# let condition = true;\nlet x;\nif condition {\n    x = Box::new(0);        // x was uninit; just overwrite.\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n}\n                            // x goes out of scope; x might be uninit;\n                            // check the flag!\n```\n\nOf course, in this case it's trivial to retrieve static drop semantics:\n\n```rust\n# let condition = true;\nif condition {\n    let x = Box::new(0);\n    println!(\"{}\", x);\n}\n```\n\nThe drop flags are tracked on the stack.\nIn old Rust versions, drop flags were stashed in a hidden field of types that implement `Drop`.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::drop-flags","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"drop-flags","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Drop Flags","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"9411099057c6744807f39de7e5c5f06b3a66077e501451b41ae4324321142cf3","sig":"eoG6YPzhyy1l8fS42H4oDo7IqYods8otlKTLKGg70lveaTwVZMv7yRAaPX8nZf8WpNZs0moui3/v1dMgwO7JDA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nWe have seen how lifetimes provide us some fairly simple rules for ensuring\nthat we never read dangling references. However up to this point we have only ever\ninteracted with the _outlives_ relationship in an inclusive manner. That is,\nwhen we talked about `'a: 'b`, it was ok for `'a` to live _exactly_ as long as\n`'b`. At first glance, this seems to be a meaningless distinction. Nothing ever\ngets dropped at the same time as another, right? This is why we used the\nfollowing desugaring of `let` statements:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet x;\nlet y;\n```\n\ndesugaring to:\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\n{\n    let x;\n    {\n        let y;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere are some more complex situations which are not possible to desugar using\nscopes, but the order is still defined ‒ variables are dropped in the reverse\norder of their definition, fields of structs and tuples in order of their\ndefinition. There are some more details about order of drop in [RFC 1857][rfc1857].\n\nLet's do this:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet tuple = (vec![], vec![]);\n```\n\nThe left vector is dropped first. But does it mean the right one strictly\noutlives it in the eyes of the borrow checker? The answer to this question is\n_no_. The borrow checker could track fields of tuples separately, but it would\nstill be unable to decide what outlives what in case of vector elements, which\nare dropped manually via pure-library code the borrow checker doesn't\nunderstand.\n\nSo why do we care? We care because if the type system isn't careful, it could\naccidentally make dangling pointers. Consider the following simple program:\n\n```rust\nstruct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8);\n\nstruct World<'a> {\n    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,\n    days: Box<u8>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut world = World {\n        inspector: None,\n        days: Box::new(1),\n    };\n    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days));\n}\n```\n\nThis program is totally sound and compiles today. The fact that `days` does not\nstrictly outlive `inspector` doesn't matter. As long as the `inspector` is\nalive, so is `days`.\n\nHowever if we add a destructor, the program will no longer compile!\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nstruct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8);\n\nimpl<'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"I was only {} days from retirement!\", self.0);\n    }\n}\n\nstruct World<'a> {\n    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,\n    days: Box<u8>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut world = World {\n        inspector: None,\n        days: Box::new(1),\n    };\n    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days));\n    // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first.\n    // Then when Inspector is dropped, it will try to read free'd memory!\n}\n```\n\n```text\nerror[E0597]: `world.days` does not live long enough\n  --> src/main.rs:19:38\n   |\n19 |     world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days));\n   |                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough\n...\n22 | }\n   | -\n   | |\n   | `world.days` dropped here while still borrowed\n   | borrow might be used here, when `world` is dropped and runs the destructor for type `World<'_>`\n```\n\nYou can try changing the order of fields or use a tuple instead of the struct,\nit'll still not compile.\n\nImplementing `Drop` lets the `Inspector` execute some arbitrary code during its\ndeath. This means it can potentially observe that types that are supposed to\nlive as long as it does actually were destroyed first.\n\nInterestingly, only generic types need to worry about this. If they aren't\ngeneric, then the only lifetimes they can harbor are `'static`, which will truly\nlive _forever_. This is why this problem is referred to as _sound generic drop_.\nSound generic drop is enforced by the _drop checker_. As of this writing, some\nof the finer details of how the drop checker (also called dropck) validates\ntypes is totally up in the air. However The Big Rule is the subtlety that we\nhave focused on this whole section:\n\n**For a generic type to soundly implement drop, its generics arguments must\nstrictly outlive it.**\n\nObeying this rule is (usually) necessary to satisfy the borrow\nchecker; obeying it is sufficient but not necessary to be\nsound. That is, if your type obeys this rule then it's definitely\nsound to drop.\n\nThe reason that it is not always necessary to satisfy the above rule\nis that some Drop implementations will not access borrowed data even\nthough their type gives them the capability for such access, or because we know\nthe specific drop order and the borrowed data is still fine even if the borrow\nchecker doesn't know that.\n\nFor example, this variant of the above `Inspector` example will never\naccess borrowed data:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nstruct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8, &'static str);\n\nimpl<'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.\", self.1);\n    }\n}\n\nstruct World<'a> {\n    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,\n    days: Box<u8>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut world = World {\n        inspector: None,\n        days: Box::new(1),\n    };\n    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days, \"gadget\"));\n    // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first.\n    // Even when Inspector is dropped, its destructor will not access the\n    // borrowed `days`.\n}\n```\n\nLikewise, this variant will also never access borrowed data:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nstruct Inspector<T>(T, &'static str);\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Inspector<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.\", self.1);\n    }\n}\n\nstruct World<T> {\n    inspector: Option<Inspector<T>>,\n    days: Box<u8>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut world = World {\n        inspector: None,\n        days: Box::new(1),\n    };\n    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days, \"gadget\"));\n    // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first.\n    // Even when Inspector is dropped, its destructor will not access the\n    // borrowed `days`.\n}\n```\n\nHowever, _both_ of the above variants are rejected by the borrow\nchecker during the analysis of `fn main`, saying that `days` does not\nlive long enough.\n\nThe reason is that the borrow checking analysis of `main` does not\nknow about the internals of each `Inspector`'s `Drop` implementation. As\nfar as the borrow checker knows while it is analyzing `main`, the body\nof an inspector's destructor might access that borrowed data.\n\nTherefore, the drop checker forces all borrowed data in a value to\nstrictly outlive that value.\n\n## An Escape Hatch\n\nThe precise rules that govern drop checking may be less restrictive in\nthe future.\n\nThe current analysis is deliberately conservative and trivial; it forces all\nborrowed data in a value to outlive that value, which is certainly sound.\n\nFuture versions of the language may make the analysis more precise, to\nreduce the number of cases where sound code is rejected as unsafe.\nThis would help address cases such as the two `Inspector`s above that\nknow not to inspect during destruction.\n\nIn the meantime, there is an unstable attribute that one can use to\nassert (unsafely) that a generic type's destructor is _guaranteed_ to\nnot access any expired data, even if its type gives it the capability\nto do so.\n\nThat attribute is called `may_dangle` and was introduced in [RFC 1327][rfc1327].\nTo deploy it on the `Inspector` from above, we would write:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(dropck_eyepatch)]\n\nstruct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8, &'static str);\n\nunsafe impl<#[may_dangle] 'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.\", self.1);\n    }\n}\n\nstruct World<'a> {\n    days: Box<u8>,\n    inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut world = World {\n        inspector: None,\n        days: Box::new(1),\n    };\n    world.inspector = Some(Inspector(&world.days, \"gadget\"));\n}\n```\n\nUse of this attribute requires the `Drop` impl to be marked `unsafe` because the\ncompiler is not checking the implicit assertion that no potentially expired data\n(e.g. `self.0` above) is accessed.\n\nThe attribute can be applied to any number of lifetime and type parameters. In\nthe following example, we assert that we access no data behind a reference of\nlifetime `'b` and that the only uses of `T` will be moves or drops, but omit\nthe attribute from `'a` and `U`, because we do access data with that lifetime\nand that type:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(dropck_eyepatch)]\nuse std::fmt::Display;\n\nstruct Inspector<'a, 'b, T, U: Display>(&'a u8, &'b u8, T, U);\n\nunsafe impl<'a, #[may_dangle] 'b, #[may_dangle] T, U: Display> Drop for Inspector<'a, 'b, T, U> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Inspector({}, _, _, {})\", self.0, self.3);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is sometimes obvious that no such access can occur, like the case above.\nHowever, when dealing with a generic type parameter, such access can\noccur indirectly. Examples of such indirect access are:\n\n- invoking a callback,\n- via a trait method call.\n\n(Future changes to the language, such as impl specialization, may add\nother avenues for such indirect access.)\n\nHere is an example of invoking a callback:\n\n```rust\nstruct Inspector<T>(T, &'static str, Box<for <'r> fn(&'r T) -> String>);\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Inspector<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        // The `self.2` call could access a borrow e.g. if `T` is `&'a _`.\n        println!(\"Inspector({}, {}) unwittingly inspects expired data.\",\n                 (self.2)(&self.0), self.1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example of a trait method call:\n\n```rust\nuse std::fmt;\n\nstruct Inspector<T: fmt::Display>(T, &'static str);\n\nimpl<T: fmt::Display> Drop for Inspector<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        // There is a hidden call to `<T as Display>::fmt` below, which\n        // could access a borrow e.g. if `T` is `&'a _`\n        println!(\"Inspector({}, {}) unwittingly inspects expired data.\",\n                 self.0, self.1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd of course, all of these accesses could be further hidden within\nsome other method invoked by the destructor, rather than being written\ndirectly within it.\n\nIn all of the above cases where the `&'a u8` is accessed in the\ndestructor, adding the `#[may_dangle]`\nattribute makes the type vulnerable to misuse that the borrow\nchecker will not catch, inviting havoc. It is better to avoid adding\nthe attribute.\n\n## A related side note about drop order\n\nWhile the drop order of fields inside a struct is defined, relying on it is\nfragile and subtle.

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nAlthough programs should use unwinding sparingly, there's a lot of code that\n*can* panic. If you unwrap a None, index out of bounds, or divide by 0, your\nprogram will panic. On debug builds, every arithmetic operation can panic\nif it overflows. Unless you are very careful and tightly control what code runs,\npretty much everything can unwind, and you need to be ready for it.\n\nBeing ready for unwinding is often referred to as *exception safety*\nin the broader programming world. In Rust, there are two levels of exception\nsafety that one may concern themselves with:\n\n* In unsafe code, we *must* be exception safe to the point of not violating\n  memory safety. We'll call this *minimal* exception safety.\n\n* In safe code, it is *good* to be exception safe to the point of your program\n  doing the right thing. We'll call this *maximal* exception safety.\n\nAs is the case in many places in Rust, Unsafe code must be ready to deal with\nbad Safe code when it comes to unwinding. Code that transiently creates\nunsound states must be careful that a panic does not cause that state to be\nused. Generally this means ensuring that only non-panicking code is run while\nthese states exist, or making a guard that cleans up the state in the case of\na panic. This does not necessarily mean that the state a panic witnesses is a\nfully coherent state. We need only guarantee that it's a *safe* state.\n\nMost Unsafe code is leaf-like, and therefore fairly easy to make exception-safe.\nIt controls all the code that runs, and most of that code can't panic. However\nit is not uncommon for Unsafe code to work with arrays of temporarily\nuninitialized data while repeatedly invoking caller-provided code. Such code\nneeds to be careful and consider exception safety.\n\n## Vec::push_all\n\n`Vec::push_all` is a temporary hack to get extending a Vec by a slice reliably\nefficient without specialization. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T: Clone> Vec<T> {\n    fn push_all(&mut self, to_push: &[T]) {\n        self.reserve(to_push.len());\n        unsafe {\n            // can't overflow because we just reserved this\n            self.set_len(self.len() + to_push.len());\n\n            for (i, x) in to_push.iter().enumerate() {\n                self.ptr().add(i).write(x.clone());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe bypass `push` in order to avoid redundant capacity and `len` checks on the\nVec that we definitely know has capacity. The logic is totally correct, except\nthere's a subtle problem with our code: it's not exception-safe! `set_len`,\n`add`, and `write` are all fine; `clone` is the panic bomb we over-looked.\n\nClone is completely out of our control, and is totally free to panic. If it\ndoes, our function will exit early with the length of the Vec set too large. If\nthe Vec is looked at or dropped, uninitialized memory will be read!\n\nThe fix in this case is fairly simple. If we want to guarantee that the values\nwe *did* clone are dropped, we can set the `len` every loop iteration. If we\njust want to guarantee that uninitialized memory can't be observed, we can set\nthe `len` after the loop.\n\n## BinaryHeap::sift_up\n\nBubbling an element up a heap is a bit more complicated than extending a Vec.\nThe pseudocode is as follows:\n\n```text\nbubble_up(heap, index):\n    while index != 0 && heap[index] < heap[parent(index)]:\n        heap.swap(index, parent(index))\n        index = parent(index)\n```\n\nA literal transcription of this code to Rust is totally fine, but has an annoying\nperformance characteristic: the `self` element is swapped over and over again\nuselessly. We would rather have the following:\n\n```text\nbubble_up(heap, index):\n    let elem = heap[index]\n    while index != 0 && elem < heap[parent(index)]:\n        heap[index] = heap[parent(index)]\n        index = parent(index)\n    heap[index] = elem\n```\n\nThis code ensures that each element is copied as little as possible (it is in\nfact necessary that elem be copied twice in general). However it now exposes\nsome exception safety trouble! At all times, there exists two copies of one\nvalue. If we panic in this function something will be double-dropped.\nUnfortunately, we also don't have full control of the code: that comparison is\nuser-defined!\n\nUnlike Vec, the fix isn't as easy here. One option is to break the user-defined\ncode and the unsafe code into two separate phases:\n\n```text\nbubble_up(heap, index):\n    let end_index = index;\n    while end_index != 0 && heap[end_index] < heap[parent(end_index)]:\n        end_index = parent(end_index)\n\n    let elem = heap[index]\n    while index != end_index:\n        heap[index] = heap[parent(index)]\n        index = parent(index)\n    heap[index] = elem\n```\n\nIf the user-defined code blows up, that's no problem anymore, because we haven't\nactually touched the state of the heap yet. Once we do start messing with the\nheap, we're working with only data and functions that we trust, so there's no\nconcern of panics.\n\nPerhaps you're not happy with this design. Surely it's cheating! And we have\nto do the complex heap traversal *twice*! Alright, let's bite the bullet. Let's\nintermix untrusted and unsafe code *for reals*.\n\nIf Rust had `try` and `finally` like in Java, we could do the following:\n\n```text\nbubble_up(heap, index):\n    let elem = heap[index]\n    try:\n        while index != 0 && elem < heap[parent(index)]:\n            heap[index] = heap[parent(index)]\n            index = parent(index)\n    finally:\n        heap[index] = elem\n```\n\nThe basic idea is simple: if the comparison panics, we just toss the loose\nelement in the logically uninitialized index and bail out. Anyone who observes\nthe heap will see a potentially *inconsistent* heap, but at least it won't\ncause any double-drops! If the algorithm terminates normally, then this\noperation happens to coincide precisely with how we finish up regardless.\n\nSadly, Rust has no such construct, so we're going to need to roll our own! The\nway to do this is to store the algorithm's state in a separate struct with a\ndestructor for the \"finally\" logic. Whether we panic or not, that destructor\nwill run and clean up after us.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nstruct Hole<'a, T: 'a> {\n    data: &'a mut [T],\n    /// `elt` is always `Some` from new until drop.\n    elt: Option<T>,\n    pos: usize,\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> Hole<'a, T> {\n    fn new(data: &'a mut [T], pos: usize) -> Self {\n        unsafe {\n            let elt = ptr::read(&data[pos]);\n            Hole {\n                data,\n                elt: Some(elt),\n                pos,\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn pos(&self) -> usize { self.pos }\n\n    fn removed(&self) -> &T { self.elt.as_ref().unwrap() }\n\n    fn get(&self, index: usize) -> &T { &self.data[index] }\n\n    unsafe fn move_to(&mut self, index: usize) {\n        let index_ptr: *const _ = &self.data[index];\n        let hole_ptr = &mut self.data[self.pos];\n        ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(index_ptr, hole_ptr, 1);\n        self.pos = index;\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, T> Drop for Hole<'a, T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        // fill the hole again\n        unsafe {\n            let pos = self.pos;\n            ptr::write(&mut self.data[pos], self.elt.take().unwrap());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T: Ord> BinaryHeap<T> {\n    fn sift_up(&mut self, pos: usize) {\n        unsafe {\n            // Take out the value at `pos` and create a hole.\n            let mut hole = Hole::new(&mut self.data, pos);\n\n            while hole.pos() != 0 {\n                let parent = parent(hole.pos());\n                if hole.removed() <= hole.get(parent) { break }\n                hole.move_to(parent);\n            }\n            // Hole will be unconditionally filled here; panic or not!\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::exception-safety","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"exception-safety","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","panic","undefined_behavior","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Exception Safety","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"d5e1d8b994603221aeed9a854f1d0d444b1252f38b6ba682a06f203f15ffb51a","sig":"OoegRX+rx+FO8LCbF9qdmwcbDT07IyugHrziTWJCXzAB/mSVvH1iJjgk6Dy7hWOlKZXahLB9SPBn/HHnw3LeDQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nMost of the time, we expect types to have a statically known and positive size.\nThis isn't always the case in Rust.\n\n## Dynamically Sized Types (DSTs)\n\nRust supports Dynamically Sized Types (DSTs): types without a statically\nknown size or alignment. On the surface, this is a bit nonsensical: Rust *must*\nknow the size and alignment of something in order to correctly work with it! In\nthis regard, DSTs are not normal types. Since they lack a statically known\nsize, these types can only exist behind a pointer. Any pointer to a\nDST consequently becomes a *wide* pointer consisting of the pointer and the\ninformation that \"completes\" them (more on this below).\n\nThere are two major DSTs exposed by the language:\n\n* trait objects: `dyn MyTrait`\n* slices: [`[T]`][slice], [`str`], and others\n\nA trait object represents some type that implements the traits it specifies.\nThe exact original type is *erased* in favor of runtime reflection\nwith a vtable containing all the information necessary to use the type.\nThe information that completes a trait object pointer is the vtable pointer.\nThe runtime size of the pointee can be dynamically requested from the vtable.\n\nA slice is simply a view into some contiguous storage -- typically an array or\n`Vec`. The information that completes a slice pointer is just the number of elements\nit points to. The runtime size of the pointee is just the statically known size\nof an element multiplied by the number of elements.\n\nStructs can actually store a single DST directly as their last field, but this\nmakes them a DST as well:\n\n```rust\n// Can't be stored on the stack directly\nstruct MySuperSlice {\n    info: u32,\n    data: [u8],\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately, such a type is largely useless without a way to construct it. Currently the\nonly properly supported way to create a custom DST is by making your type generic\nand performing an *unsizing coercion*:\n\n```rust\nstruct MySuperSliceable<T: ?Sized> {\n    info: u32,\n    data: T,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let sized: MySuperSliceable<[u8; 8]> = MySuperSliceable {\n        info: 17,\n        data: [0; 8],\n    };\n\n    let dynamic: &MySuperSliceable<[u8]> = &sized;\n\n    // prints: \"17 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    println!(\"{} {:?}\", dynamic.info, &dynamic.data);\n}\n```\n\n(Yes, custom DSTs are a largely half-baked feature for now.)\n\n## Zero Sized Types (ZSTs)\n\nRust also allows types to be specified that occupy no space:\n\n```rust\nstruct Nothing; // No fields = no size\n\n// All fields have no size = no size\nstruct LotsOfNothing {\n    foo: Nothing,\n    qux: (),      // empty tuple has no size\n    baz: [u8; 0], // empty array has no size\n}\n```\n\nOn their own, Zero Sized Types (ZSTs) are, for obvious reasons, pretty useless.\nHowever as with many curious layout choices in Rust, their potential is realized\nin a generic context: Rust largely understands that any operation that produces\nor stores a ZST can be reduced to a no-op. First off, storing it doesn't even\nmake sense -- it doesn't occupy any space. Also there's only one value of that\ntype, so anything that loads it can just produce it from the aether -- which is\nalso a no-op since it doesn't occupy any space.\n\nOne of the most extreme examples of this is Sets and Maps. Given a\n`Map<Key, Value>`, it is common to implement a `Set<Key>` as just a thin wrapper\naround `Map<Key, UselessJunk>`. In many languages, this would necessitate\nallocating space for UselessJunk and doing work to store and load UselessJunk\nonly to discard it. Proving this unnecessary would be a difficult analysis for\nthe compiler.\n\nHowever in Rust, we can just say that  `Set<Key> = Map<Key, ()>`. Now Rust\nstatically knows that every load and store is useless, and no allocation has any\nsize. The result is that the monomorphized code is basically a custom\nimplementation of a HashSet with none of the overhead that HashMap would have to\nsupport values.\n\nSafe code need not worry about ZSTs, but *unsafe* code must be careful about the\nconsequence of types with no size. In particular, pointer offsets are no-ops,\nand allocators typically [require a non-zero size][alloc].\n\nNote that references to ZSTs (including empty slices), just like all other\nreferences, must be non-null and suitably aligned. However, loading or storing\nthrough a null pointer to a ZST is not [undefined behavior][ub], unlike\npointers to other types.\n\n[alloc]: ../std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html#tymethod.alloc\n[ub]: what-unsafe-does.html\n\n## Empty Types\n\nRust also enables types to be declared that *cannot even be instantiated*. These\ntypes can only be talked about at the type level, and never at the value level.\nEmpty types can be declared by specifying an enum with no variants:\n\n```rust\nenum Void {} // No variants = EMPTY\n```\n\nEmpty types are even more marginal than ZSTs. The primary motivating example for\nan empty type is type-level unreachability. For instance, suppose an API needs to\nreturn a Result in general, but a specific case actually is infallible. It's\nactually possible to communicate this at the type level by returning a\n`Result<T, Void>`. Consumers of the API can confidently unwrap such a Result\nknowing that it's *statically impossible* for this value to be an `Err`, as\nthis would require providing a value of type `Void`.\n\nIn principle, Rust can do some interesting analyses and optimizations based\non this fact. For instance, `Result<T, Void>` is represented as just `T`,\nbecause the `Err` case doesn't actually exist (strictly speaking, this is only\nan optimization that is not guaranteed, so for example transmuting one into the\nother is still Undefined Behavior).\n\nThe following also compiles:\n\n```rust\nenum Void {}\n\nlet res: Result<u32, Void> = Ok(0);\n\n// Err doesn't exist anymore, so Ok is actually irrefutable.\nlet Ok(num) = res;\n```\n\nOne final subtle detail about empty types is that raw pointers to them are\nactually valid to construct, but dereferencing them is Undefined Behavior\nbecause that wouldn't make sense.\n\nWe recommend against modelling C's `void*` type with `*const Void`.\nA lot of people started doing that but quickly ran into trouble because\nRust doesn't really have any safety guards against trying to instantiate\nempty types with unsafe code, and if you do it, it's Undefined Behavior.\nThis was especially problematic because developers had a habit of converting\nraw pointers to references and `&Void` is *also* Undefined Behavior to\nconstruct.\n\n`*const ()` (or equivalent) works reasonably well for `void*`, and can be made\ninto a reference without any safety problems. It still doesn't prevent you from\ntrying to read or write values, but at least it compiles to a no-op instead\nof Undefined Behavior.\n\n## Extern Types\n\nThere is [an accepted RFC][extern-types] to add proper types with an unknown size,\ncalled *extern types*, which would let Rust developers model things like C's `void*`\nand other \"declared but never defined\" types more accurately. However as of\nRust 2018, [the feature is stuck in limbo over how `size_of_val::<MyExternType>()`\nshould behave][extern-types-issue].\n\n[extern-types]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1861-extern-types.md\n[extern-types-issue]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43467\n[`str`]: ../std/primitive.str.html\n[slice]: ../std/primitive.slice.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::exotic-sizes","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"exotic-sizes","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","type_coercion","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Exotically Sized Types","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"991b15c064ca9e58da32abd5f82a7ce2a67afef5384ec51c41ccac66f1108735","sig":"K7+ODyNV+K9iZDPC1c3HFuPvfH9XzomujGgOC1MeR9lqi7g/kS6XRZxdoMP3xatcDs6J62bU8bSfe/Vw7iWBBA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis guide will use the [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)\ncompression/decompression library as an introduction to writing bindings for\nforeign code. Rust is currently unable to call directly into a C++ library, but\nsnappy includes a C interface (documented in\n[`snappy-c.h`](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/snappy-c.h)).\n\n## A note about libc\n\nMany of these examples use [the `libc` crate][libc], which provides various\ntype definitions for C types, among other things. If you’re trying these\nexamples yourself, you’ll need to add `libc` to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibc = \"0.2.0\"\n```\n\n[libc]: https://crates.io/crates/libc\n\n## Calling foreign functions\n\nThe following is a minimal example of calling a foreign function which will\ncompile if snappy is installed:\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse libc::size_t;\n\n#[link(name = \"snappy\")]\nunsafe extern \"C\" {\n    fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = unsafe { snappy_max_compressed_length(100) };\n    println!(\"max compressed length of a 100 byte buffer: {}\", x);\n}\n```\n\nThe `extern` block is a list of function signatures in a foreign library, in\nthis case with the platform's C ABI. The `#[link(...)]` attribute is used to\ninstruct the linker to link against the snappy library so the symbols are\nresolved.\n\nForeign functions are assumed to be unsafe so calls to them need to be wrapped\nwith `unsafe {}` as a promise to the compiler that everything contained within\ntruly is safe. C libraries often expose interfaces that aren't thread-safe, and\nalmost any function that takes a pointer argument isn't valid for all possible\ninputs since the pointer could be dangling, and raw pointers fall outside of\nRust's safe memory model.\n\nWhen declaring the argument types to a foreign function, the Rust compiler\ncannot check if the declaration is correct, so specifying it correctly is part\nof keeping the binding correct at runtime.\n\nThe `extern` block can be extended to cover the entire snappy API:\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse libc::{c_int, size_t};\n\n#[link(name = \"snappy\")]\nunsafe extern {\n    fn snappy_compress(input: *const u8,\n                       input_length: size_t,\n                       compressed: *mut u8,\n                       compressed_length: *mut size_t) -> c_int;\n    fn snappy_uncompress(compressed: *const u8,\n                         compressed_length: size_t,\n                         uncompressed: *mut u8,\n                         uncompressed_length: *mut size_t) -> c_int;\n    fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t;\n    fn snappy_uncompressed_length(compressed: *const u8,\n                                  compressed_length: size_t,\n                                  result: *mut size_t) -> c_int;\n    fn snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(compressed: *const u8,\n                                         compressed_length: size_t) -> c_int;\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\n## Creating a safe interface\n\nThe raw C API needs to be wrapped to provide memory safety and make use of higher-level concepts\nlike vectors. A library can choose to expose only the safe, high-level interface and hide the unsafe\ninternal details.\n\nWrapping the functions which expect buffers involves using the `slice::raw` module to manipulate Rust\nvectors as pointers to memory. Rust's vectors are guaranteed to be a contiguous block of memory. The\nlength is the number of elements currently contained, and the capacity is the total size in elements of\nthe allocated memory. The length is less than or equal to the capacity.\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\n# use libc::{c_int, size_t};\n# unsafe fn snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(_: *const u8, _: size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# fn main() {}\npub fn validate_compressed_buffer(src: &[u8]) -> bool {\n    unsafe {\n        snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(src.as_ptr(), src.len() as size_t) == 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `validate_compressed_buffer` wrapper above makes use of an `unsafe` block, but it makes the\nguarantee that calling it is safe for all inputs by leaving off `unsafe` from the function\nsignature.\n\nThe `snappy_compress` and `snappy_uncompress` functions are more complex, since a buffer has to be\nallocated to hold the output too.\n\nThe `snappy_max_compressed_length` function can be used to allocate a vector with the maximum\nrequired capacity to hold the compressed output. The vector can then be passed to the\n`snappy_compress` function as an output parameter. An output parameter is also passed to retrieve\nthe true length after compression for setting the length.\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\n# use libc::{size_t, c_int};\n# unsafe fn snappy_compress(a: *const u8, b: size_t, c: *mut u8,\n#                           d: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_max_compressed_length(a: size_t) -> size_t { a }\n# fn

     dst.set_len(dstlen as usize);\n        dst\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDecompression is similar, because snappy stores the uncompressed size as part of the compression\nformat and `snappy_uncompressed_length` will retrieve the exact buffer size required.\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\n# use libc::{size_t, c_int};\n# unsafe fn

guarantee\nthe release of these resources (especially in the case of panic).\n\nFor more about destructors, see the [Drop trait](../std/ops/trait.Drop.html).\n\n## Calling Rust code from C\n\nYou may wish to compile Rust code in a way so that it can be called from C.\nThis is fairly easy, but requires a few things.\n\n### Rust side\n\nFirst, we assume you have a lib crate named as `rust_from_c`.\n`lib.rs` should have Rust code as following:\n\n```rust\n#[unsafe(no_mangle)]\npub extern \"C\" fn hello_from_rust() {\n    println!(\"Hello from Rust!\");\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nThe `extern \"C\"` makes this function adhere to the C calling convention, as discussed below in \"[Foreign Calling Conventions]\".\nThe `no_mangle` attribute turns off Rust's name mangling, so that it has a well defined symbol to link to.\n\nThen, to compile Rust code as a shared library that can be called from C, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n```\n\n(NOTE: We could also use the `staticlib` crate type but it needs to tweak some linking flags.)\n\nRun `cargo build` and you're ready to go on the Rust side.\n\n[Foreign Calling Conventions]: ffi.md#foreign-calling-conventions\n\n### C side\n\nWe'll create a C file to call the `hello_from_rust` function and compile it by `gcc`.\n\nC file should look like:\n\n```c\nextern void hello_from_rust();\n\nint main(void) {\n    hello_from_rust();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWe name the file as `call_rust.c` and place it on the crate root.\nRun the following to compile:\n\n```sh\ngcc call_rust.c -o call_rust -lrust_from_c -L./target/debug\n```\n\n`-l` and `-L` tell gcc to find our Rust library.\n\nFinally, we can call Rust code from C with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` specified:\n\n```sh\n$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./target/debug ./call_rust\nHello from Rust!\n```\n\nThat's it!\nFor more realistic example, check the [`cbindgen`].\n\n[`cbindgen`]: https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen\n\n## Callbacks from C code to Rust functions\n\nSome external libraries require the usage of callbacks to report back their\ncurrent state or intermediate data to the caller.\nIt is possible to pass functions defined in Rust to an external library.\nThe requirement for this is that the callback function is marked as `extern`\nwith the correct calling convention to make it callable from C code.\n\nThe callback function can then be sent through a registration call\nto the C library and afterwards be invoked from there.\n\nA basic example is:\n\nRust code:\n\n```rust,no_run\nextern fn callback(a: i32) {\n    println!(\"I'm called from C with value {0}\", a);\n}\n\n#[link(name = \"extlib\")]\nunsafe extern {\n   fn register_callback(cb: extern fn(i32)) -> i32;\n   fn trigger_callback();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe {\n        register_callback(callback);\n        trigger_callback(); // Triggers the callback.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nC code:\n\n```c\ntypedef void (*rust_callback)(int32_t);\nrust_callback cb;\n\nint32_t register_callback(rust_callback callback) {\n    cb = callback;\n    return 1;\n}\n\nvoid trigger_callback() {\n  cb(7); // Will call callback(7) in Rust.\n}\n```\n\nIn this example Rust's `main()` will call `trigger_callback()` in C,\nwhich would, in turn, call back to `callback()` in Rust.\n\n## Targeting callbacks to Rust objects\n\nThe former example showed how a global function can be called from C code.\nHowever it is often desired that the callback is targeted to a special\nRust object. This could be the object that represents the wrapper for the\nrespective C object.\n\nThis can be achieved by passing a raw pointer to the object down to the\nC library. The C library can then include the pointer to the Rust object in\nthe notification. This will allow the callback to unsafely access the\nreferenced Rust object.\n\nRust code:\n\n```rust,no_run\nstruct RustObject {\n    a: i32,\n    // Other members...\n}\n\nunsafe extern \"C\" fn callback(target: *mut RustObject, a: i32) {\n    println!(\"I'm called from C with value {0}\", a);\n    unsafe {\n        // Update the value in RustObject with the value received from the callback:\n        (*target).a = a;\n    }\n}\n\n#[link(name = \"extlib\")]\nunsafe extern {\n   fn register_callback(target: *mut RustObject,\n                        cb: unsafe extern fn(*mut RustObject, i32)) -> i32;\n   fn trigger_callback();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create the object that will be referenced in the callback:\n    let mut rust_object = Box::new(RustObject { a: 5 });\n\n    unsafe {\n        register_callback(&mut *rust_object, callback);\n        trigger_callback();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nC code:\n\n```c\ntypedef void (*rust_callback)(void*, int32_t);\nvoid* cb_target;\nrust_callback cb;\n\nint32_t register_callback(void* callback_target, rust_callback callback) {\n    cb_target = callback_target;\n    cb = callback;\n    return 1;\n}\n\nvoid trigger_callback() {\n  cb(cb_target, 7); // Will call callback(&rustObject, 7) in Rust.\n}\n```\n\n## Asynchronous callbacks\n\nIn the previously given examples the callbacks are invoked as a direct reaction\nto a function call to the external C library.\nThe control over the current thread is switched from Rust to C to Rust for the\nexecution of the callback, but in the end the callback is executed on the\nsame thread that called the function which triggered the callback.\n\nThings get more complicated when the external library spawns its own threads\nand invokes callbacks from there.\nIn these cases access to Rust data structures inside the callbacks is\nespecially unsafe and proper synchronization mechanisms must be used.\nBesides classical synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, one possibility in\nRust is to use channels (in `std::sync::mpsc`) to forward data from the C\nthread that invoked the callback into a Rust thread.\n\nIf an asynchronous callback targets a special object in the Rust address space\nit is also absolutely necessary that no more callbacks are performed by the\nC library after the respective Rust object gets destroyed.\nThis can be achieved by unregistering the callback in the object's\ndestructor and designing the library in a way that guarantees that no\ncallback will be performed after deregistration.\n\n## Linking\n\nThe `link` attribute on `extern` blocks provides the basic building block for\ninstructing rustc how it will link to native libraries. There are two accepted\nforms of the link attribute today:\n\n* `#[link(name = \"foo\")]`\n* `#[link(name = \"foo\", kind = \"bar\")]`\n\nIn both of these cases, `foo` is the name of the native library that we're\nlinking to, and in the second case `bar` is the type of native library that the\ncompiler is linking to. There are currently three known types of native\nlibraries:\n\n* Dynamic - `#[link(name = \"readline\")]`\n* Static - `#[link(name = \"my_build_dependency\", kind = \"static\")]`\n* Frameworks - `#[link(name = \"CoreFoundation\", kind = \"framework\")]`\n\nNote that frameworks are only available on macOS targets.\n\nThe different `kind` values are meant to differentiate how the native library\nparticipates in linkage. From a linkage perspective, the Rust compiler creates\ntwo flavors of artifacts: partial (rlib/staticlib) and final (dylib/binary).\nNative dynamic library and framework dependencies are propagated to the final\nartifact boundary, while static library dependencies are not propagated at\nall, because the static libraries are integrated directly into the subsequent\nartifact.\n\nA few examples of how this model can be used are:\n\n* A native build dependency. Sometimes some C/C++ glue is needed when writing\n  some Rust code, but distribution of the C/C++ code in a library format is\n  a burden. In this case, the code will be archived into `libfoo.a` and then the\n  Rust crate would declare a dependency via `#[link(name = \"foo\", kind =\n  \"static\")]`.\n\n  Regardless of the flavor of output for the crate, the native static library\n  will be included in the output, meaning that distribution of the native static\n  library is not necessary.\n\n* A normal dynamic dependency. Common system libraries (like `readline`) are\n  available on a large number of systems, and often a static copy of these\n  libraries cannot be found. When this dependency is included in a Rust crate,\n  partial targets (like rlibs) will not link to the library, but when the rlib\n  is included in a final target (like a binary), the native library will be\n  linked in.\n\nOn macOS, frameworks behave with the same semantics as a dynamic library.\n\n## Unsafe blocks\n\nSome operations, like dereferencing raw pointers or calling functions that have been marked\nunsafe are only allowed inside unsafe blocks. Unsafe blocks isolate unsafety and are a promise to\nthe compiler that the unsafety does not leak out of the block.\n\nUnsafe functions, on the other hand, advertise it to the world. An unsafe function is written like\nthis:\n\n```rust\nunsafe fn kaboom(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 { *ptr }\n```\n\nThis function can only be called from an `unsafe` block or another `unsafe` function.\n\n## Accessing foreign globals\n\nForeign APIs often export a global variable which could do something like track\nglobal state. In order to access these variables, you declare them in `extern`\nblocks with the `static` keyword:\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\n#[link(name = \"readline\")]\nunsafe extern {\n    static rl_readline_version: libc::c_int;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"You have readline version {} installed.\",\n             unsafe { rl_readline_version as i32 });\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you may need to alter global state provided by a foreign\ninterface. To do this, statics can be declared with `mut` so we can mutate\nthem.\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::ffi::CString;\nuse std::ptr;\n\n#[link(name = \"readline\")]\nunsafe extern {\n    static mut rl_prompt: *const libc::c_char;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let prompt = CString::new(\"[my-awesome-shell] $\").unwrap();\n    unsafe {\n        rl_prompt = prompt.as_ptr();\n\n        println!(\"{:?}\", rl_prompt);\n\n        rl_prompt = ptr::null();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that all interaction with a `static mut` is unsafe, both reading and\nwriting. Dealing with global mutable state requires a great deal of care.\n\n## Foreign calling conventions\n\nMost foreign code exposes a C ABI, and Rust uses the platform's C calling convention by default when\ncalling foreign functions. Some foreign functions, most notably the Windows API, use other calling\nconventions. Rust provides a way to tell the compiler which convention to use:\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\n#[cfg(all(target_os = \"win32\", target_arch = \"x86\"))]\n#[link(name = \"kernel32\")]\n#[allow(non_snake_case)]\nunsafe extern \"stdcall\" {\n    fn SetEnvironmentVariableA(n: *const u8, v: *const u8) -> libc::c_int;\n}\n# fn main() { }\n```\n\nThis applies to the entire `extern` block. The list of supported ABI constraints\nare:\n\n* `stdcall`\n* `aapcs`\n* `cdecl`\n* `fastcall`\n* `thiscall`\n* `vectorcall`\nThis is currently hidden behind the `abi_vectorcall` gate and is subject to change.\n* `Rust`\n* `system`\n* `C`\n* `win64`\n* `sysv64`\n\nMost of the abis in this list are self-explanatory, but the `system` abi may\nseem a little odd. This constraint selects whatever the appropriate ABI is for\ninteroperating with the target's libraries. For example, on win32 with a x86\narchitecture, this means that the abi used would be `stdcall`. On x86_64,\nhowever, windows uses the `C` calling convention, so `C` would be used. This\nmeans that in our previous example, we could have used `extern \"system\" { ... }`\nto define a block for all windows systems, not only x86 ones.\n\n## Interoperability with foreign code\n\nRust guarantees that the layout of a `struct` is compatible with the platform's\nrepresentation in C only if the `#[repr(C)]` attribute is applied to it.\n`#[repr(C, packed)]` can be used to lay out struct members without padding.\n`#[repr(C)]` can also be applied to an enum.\n\nRust's owned boxes (`Box<T>`) use non-nullable pointers as handles which point\nto the contained object. However, they should not be manually created because\nthey are managed by internal allocators. References can safely be assumed to be\nnon-nullable pointers directly to the type.  However, breaking the borrow\nchecking or mutability rules is not guaranteed to be safe, so prefer using raw\npointers (`*`) if that's needed because the compiler can't make as many\nassumptions about them.\n\nVectors and strings share the same basic memory layout, and utilities are\navailable in the `vec` and `str` modules for working with C APIs. However,\nstrings are not terminated with `\\0`. If you need a NUL-terminated string for\ninteroperability with C, you should use the `CString` type in the `std::ffi`\nmodule.\n\nThe [`libc` crate on crates.io][libc] includes type aliases and function\ndefinitions for the C standard library in the `libc` module, and Rust links\nagainst `libc` and `libm` by default.\n\n## Variadic functions\n\nIn C, functions can be 'variadic', meaning they accept a variable number of arguments. This can\nbe achieved in Rust by specifying `...` within the argument list of a foreign function declaration:\n\n```no_run\nunsafe extern {\n    fn foo(x: i32, ...);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe {\n        foo(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNormal Rust functions can *not* be variadic:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\n// This will not compile\n\nfn foo(x: i32, ...) {}\n```\n\n## The \"nullable pointer optimization\"\n\nCertain Rust types are defined to never be `null`. This includes references (`&T`,\n`&mut T`), boxes (`Box<T>`), and function pointers (`extern \"abi\" fn()`). When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types.\nHowever, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead.\n\nAs a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above.  This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes.\n\nThe most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`).\n\nHere is a contrived example. Let's say some C library has a facility for registering a\ncallback, which gets called in certain situations. The callback is passed a function pointer\nand an integer and it is supposed to run the function with the integer as a parameter. So\nwe have function pointers flying across the FFI boundary in both directions.\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse libc::c_int;\n\n# #[cfg(hidden)]\nunsafe extern \"C\" {\n    /// Registers the callback.\n    fn register(cb: Option<extern \"C\" fn(Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>, c_int) -> c_int>);\n}\n# unsafe fn register(_: Option<extern \"C\" fn(Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>,\n#                                            c_int) -> c_int>)\n# {}\n\n/// This fairly useless function receives a function pointer and an integer\n/// from C, and returns the result of calling the function with the integer.\n/// In case no function is provided, it squares the integer by default.\nextern \"C\" fn apply(process: Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>, int: c_int) -> c_int {\n    match process {\n        Some(f) => f(int),\n        None    => int * int\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe {\n        register(Some(apply));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the code on the C side looks like this:\n\n```c\nvoid register(int (*f)(int (*)(int), int)) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nNo `transmute` required!\n\n## FFI and unwinding\n\nIt’s important to be mindful of unwinding when working with FFI. Most\nABI strings come in two variants, one with an `-unwind` suffix and one without.\nThe `Rust` ABI always permits unwinding, so there is no `Rust-unwind` ABI.\n\nIf you expect Rust `panic`s or foreign (e.g. C++) exceptions to cross an FFI\nboundary, that boundary must use the appropriate `-unwind` ABI string.\nConversely, if you do not expect unwinding to cross an ABI boundary, use one of\nthe non-`unwind` ABI strings.\n\n> Note: Compiling with `panic=abort` will still cause `panic!` to immediately\nabort the process, regardless of which ABI is specified by the function that\n`panic`s.\n\nIf an unwinding operation does encounter an ABI boundary that is\nnot permitted to unwind, the behavior depends on the source of the unwinding\n(Rust `panic` or a foreign exception):\n\n* `panic` will cause the process to safely abort.\n* A foreign exception entering Rust will cause undefined behavior.\n\nNote that the interaction of `catch_unwind` with foreign exceptions **is\nundefined**, as is the interaction of `panic` with foreign exception-catching\nmechanisms (notably C++'s `try`/`catch`).\n\n### Rust `panic` with `\"C-unwind\"`\n\n<!-- ignore: using unstable feature -->\n```rust,ignore\n#[unsafe(no_mangle)]\nunsafe extern \"C-unwind\" fn example() {\n    panic!(\"Uh oh\");\n}\n```\n\nThis function (when compiled with `panic=unwind`) is permitted to unwind C++\nstack frames.\n\n```text\n[Rust function with `catch_unwind`, which stops the unwinding]\n      |\n     ...\n      |\n[C++ frames]\n      |                           ^\n      | (calls)                   | (unwinding\n      v                           |  goes this\n[Rust function `example`]         |  way)\n      |                           |\n      +--- rust function panics --+\n```\n\nIf the C++ frames have objects, their destructors will be called.\n\n### C++ `throw` with `\"C-unwind\"`\n\n<!-- ignore: using unstable feature -->\n```rust,ignore\n#[link(...)]\nunsafe extern \"C-unwind\" {\n    // A C++ function that may throw an exception\n    fn may_throw();\n}\n\n#[unsafe(no_mangle)]\nunsafe extern \"C-unwind\" fn rust_passthrough() {\n    let b = Box::new(5);\n    unsafe { may_throw(); }\n    println!(\"{:?}\", &b);\n}\n```\n\nA C++ function with a `try` block may invoke `rust_passthrough` and `catch` an\nexception thrown by `may_throw`.\n\n```text\n[C++ function with `try` block that invokes `rust_passthrough`]\n      |\n     ...\n      |\n[Rust function `rust_passthrough`]\n      |                            ^\n      | (calls)                    | (unwinding\n      v                            |  goes this\n[C++ function `may_throw`]         |  way)\n      |                            |\n      +--- C++ function throws ----+\n```\n\nIf `may_throw` does throw an exception, `b` will be dropped.

See the documentation of [`catch_unwind`]\nfor more information.\n\n[`catch_unwind`]: ../std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html\n\n## Representing opaque structs\n\nSometimes, a C library wants to provide a pointer to something, but not let you know the internal details of the thing it wants.\nA stable and simple way is to use a `void *` argument:\n\n```c\nvoid foo(void *arg);\nvoid bar(void *arg);\n```\n\nWe can represent this in Rust with the `c_void` type:\n\n<!-- ignore: requires libc crate -->\n```rust,ignore\nunsafe extern \"C\" {\n    pub fn foo(arg: *mut libc::c_void);\n    pub fn bar(arg: *mut libc::c_void);\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nThis is a perfectly valid way of handling the situation. However, we can do a bit\nbetter. To solve this, some C libraries will instead create a `struct`, where\nthe details and memory layout of the struct are private. This gives some amount\nof type safety. These structures are called ‘opaque’. Here’s an example, in C:\n\n```c\nstruct Foo; /* Foo is a structure, but its contents are not part of the public interface */\nstruct Bar;\nvoid foo(struct Foo *arg);\nvoid bar(struct Bar *arg);\n```\n\nTo do this in Rust, let’s create our own opaque types:\n\n```rust\n#[repr(C)]\npub struct Foo {\n    _data: (),\n    _marker:\n        core::marker::PhantomData<(*mut u8, core::marker::PhantomPinned)>,\n}\n#[repr(C)]\npub struct Bar {\n    _data: (),\n    _marker:\n        core::marker::PhantomData<(*mut u8, core::marker::PhantomPinned)>,\n}\n\nunsafe extern \"C\" {\n    pub fn foo(arg: *mut Foo);\n    pub fn bar(arg: *mut Bar);\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nBy including at least one private field and no constructor,\nwe create an opaque type that we can't instantiate outside of this module.\n(A struct with no field could be instantiated by anyone.)\nWe also want to use this type in FFI, so we have to add `#[repr(C)]`.\nThe marker ensures the compiler does not mark the struct as `Send`, `Sync`, and\n`Unpin`. (`*mut u8` is not `Send` or `Sync`, `PhantomPinned` is not `Unpin`)\n\nBut because our `Foo` and `Bar` types are\ndifferent, we’ll get type safety between the two of them, so we cannot\naccidentally pass a pointer to `Foo` to `bar()`.\n\nNotice that it is a really bad idea to use an empty enum as FFI type.\nThe compiler relies on empty enums being uninhabited, so handling values of type\n`&Empty` is a huge footgun and can lead to buggy program behavior (by triggering\nundefined behavior).\n\n> **NOTE:** The simplest way would use \"extern types\".\nBut it's currently (as of June 2021) unstable and has some unresolved questions, see the [RFC page][extern-type-rfc] and the [tracking issue][extern-type-issue] for more details.\n\n[extern-type-issue]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43467\n[extern-type-rfc]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1861-extern-types.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::ffi","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"ffi","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","panic","raw_pointer","undefined_behavior","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Foreign Function Interface","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"21d3765e45844619e41e6dd1dbf28821b6d1da62cf28b54ff898e6c264132fd4","sig":"4dY6udvy3ryBYqVGRzi5OZ2YQH7wztVYaDZNYncXjf6XKXaZvw9bGWAWEWyAH4QDesgri3xhI4f7Y37yyvfDDQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nRust's `Fn` traits are a little bit magic. For instance, we can write the\nfollowing code:\n\n```rust\nstruct Closure<F> {\n    data: (u8, u16),\n    func: F,\n}\n\nimpl<F> Closure<F>\n    where F: Fn(&(u8, u16)) -> &u8,\n{\n    fn call(&self) -> &u8 {\n        (self.func)(&self.data)\n    }\n}\n\nfn do_it(data: &(u8, u16)) -> &u8 { &data.0 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let clo = Closure { data: (0, 1), func: do_it };\n    println!(\"{}\", clo.call());\n}\n```\n\nIf we try to naively desugar this code in the same way that we did in the\n[lifetimes section][lt], we run into some trouble:\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\n// NOTE: `&'b data.0` and `'x: {` is not valid syntax!\nstruct Closure<F> {\n    data: (u8, u16),\n    func: F,\n}\n\nimpl<F> Closure<F>\n    // where F: Fn(&'???

We\nneed to provide some lifetime there, but the lifetime we care about can't be\nnamed until we enter the body of `call`! Also, that isn't some fixed lifetime;\n`call` works with *any* lifetime `&self` happens to have at that point.\n\nThis job requires The Magic of Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (HRTBs). The way we\ndesugar this is as follows:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nwhere for<'a> F: Fn(&'a (u8, u16)) -> &'a u8,\n```\n\nAlternatively:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nwhere F: for<'a> Fn(&'a (u8, u16)) -> &'a u8,\n```\n\n(Where `Fn(a, b, c) -> d` is itself just sugar for the unstable *real* `Fn`\ntrait)\n\n`for<'a>` can be read as \"for all choices of `'a`\", and basically produces an\n*infinite list* of trait bounds that F must satisfy.

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nOwnership-based resource management is intended to simplify composition. You\nacquire resources when you create the object, and you release the resources when\nit gets destroyed. Since destruction is handled for you, it means you can't\nforget to release the resources, and it happens as soon as possible! Surely this\nis perfect and all of our problems are solved.\n\nEverything is terrible and we have new and exotic problems to try to solve.\n\nMany people like to believe that Rust eliminates resource leaks. In practice,\nthis is basically true. You would be surprised to see a Safe Rust program\nleak resources in an uncontrolled way.\n\nHowever from a theoretical perspective this is absolutely not the case, no\nmatter how you look at it. In the strictest sense, \"leaking\" is so abstract as\nto be unpreventable. It's quite trivial to initialize a collection at the start\nof a program, fill it with tons of objects with destructors, and then enter an\ninfinite event loop that never refers to it. The collection will sit around\nuselessly, holding on to its precious resources until the program terminates (at\nwhich point all those resources would have been reclaimed by the OS anyway).\n\nWe may consider a more restricted form of leak: failing to drop a value that is\nunreachable. Rust also doesn't prevent this. In fact Rust *has a function for\ndoing this*: `mem::forget`. This function consumes the value it is passed *and\nthen doesn't run its destructor*.\n\nIn the past `mem::forget` was marked as unsafe as a sort of lint against using\nit, since failing to call a destructor is generally not a well-behaved thing to\ndo (though useful for some special unsafe code). However this was generally\ndetermined to be an untenable stance to take: there are many ways to fail to\ncall a destructor in safe code. The most famous example is creating a cycle of\nreference-counted pointers using interior mutability.\n\nIt is reasonable for safe code to assume that destructor leaks do not happen, as\nany program that leaks destructors is probably wrong. However *unsafe* code\ncannot rely on destructors to be run in order to be safe. For most types this\ndoesn't matter: if you leak the destructor then the type is by definition\ninaccessible, so it doesn't matter, right? For instance, if you leak a `Box<u8>`\nthen you waste some memory but that's hardly going to violate memory-safety.\n\nHowever where we must be careful with destructor leaks are *proxy* types. These\nare types which manage access to a distinct object, but don't actually own it.\nProxy objects are quite rare. Proxy objects you'll need to care about are even\nrarer. However we'll focus on three interesting examples in the standard\nlibrary:\n\n* `vec::Drain`\n* `Rc`\n* `thread::scoped::JoinGuard`\n\n## Drain\n\n`drain` is a collections API that moves data out of the container without\nconsuming the container. This enables us to reuse the allocation of a `Vec`\nafter claiming ownership over all of its contents. It produces an iterator\n(Drain) that returns the contents of the Vec by-value.\n\nNow, consider Drain in the middle of iteration: some values have been moved out,\nand others haven't. This means that part of the Vec is now full of logically\nuninitialized data! We could backshift all the elements in the Vec every time we\nremove a value, but this would have pretty catastrophic performance\nconsequences.\n\nInstead, we would like Drain to fix the Vec's backing storage when it is\ndropped. It should run itself to completion, backshift any elements that weren't\nremoved (drain supports subranges), and then fix Vec's `len`. It's even\nunwinding-safe! Easy!\n\nNow consider the following:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet mut vec = vec![Box::new(0); 4];\n\n{\n    // start draining, vec can no longer be accessed\n    let mut drainer = vec.drain(..);\n\n    // pull out two elements and immediately drop them\n    drainer.next();\n    drainer.next();\n\n    // get rid of drainer, but don't call its destructor\n    mem::forget(drainer);\n}\n\n// Oops, vec[0] was dropped, we're reading a pointer into free'd memory!\nprintln!(\"{}\", vec[0]);\n```\n\nThis is pretty clearly Not Good. Unfortunately, we're kind of stuck between a\nrock and a hard place: maintaining consistent state at every step has an\nenormous cost (and would negate any benefits of the API). Failing to maintain\nconsistent state gives us Undefined Behavior in safe code (making the API\nunsound).\n\nSo what can we do? Well, we can pick a trivially consistent state: set the Vec's\nlen to be 0 when we start the iteration, and fix it up if necessary in the\ndestructor. That way, if everything executes like normal we get the desired\nbehavior with minimal overhead. But if someone has the *audacity* to\nmem::forget us in the middle of the iteration, all that does is *leak even more*\n(and possibly leave the Vec in an unexpected but otherwise consistent state).\nSince we've accepted that mem::forget is safe, this is definitely safe. We call\nleaks causing more leaks a *leak amplification*.\n\n## Rc\n\nRc is an interesting case because at first glance it doesn't appear to be a\nproxy value at all. After all, it manages the data it points to, and dropping\nall the Rcs for a value will drop that value. Leaking an Rc doesn't seem like it\nwould be particularly dangerous. It will leave the refcount permanently\nincremented and prevent the data from being freed or dropped, but that seems\njust like Box, right?\n\nNope.\n\nLet's consider a simplified implementation of Rc:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nstruct Rc<T> {\n    ptr: *mut RcBox<T>,\n}\n\nstruct RcBox<T> {\n    data: T,\n    ref_count: usize,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Rc<T> {\n    fn new(data: T) -> Self {\n        unsafe {\n            // Wouldn't it be nice if heap::allocate worked like this?\n            let ptr = heap::allocate::<RcBox<T>>();\n            ptr::write(ptr, RcBox {\n                data,\n                ref_count: 1,\n            });\n            Rc { ptr }\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn clone(&self) -> Self {\n        unsafe {\n            (*self.ptr).ref_count += 1;\n        }\n        Rc { ptr: self.ptr }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Rc<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            (*self.ptr).ref_count -= 1;\n            if (*self.ptr).ref_count == 0 {\n                // drop the data and then free it\n                ptr::read(self.ptr);\n                heap::deallocate(self.ptr);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code contains an implicit and subtle assumption: `ref_count` can fit in a\n`usize`, because there can't be more than `usize::MAX` Rcs in memory. However\nthis itself assumes that the `ref_count` accurately reflects the number of Rcs\nin memory, which we know is false with `mem::forget`. Using `mem::forget` we can\noverflow the `ref_count`, and then get it down to 0 with outstanding Rcs. Then\nwe can happily use-after-free the inner data. Bad Bad Not Good.\n\nThis can be solved by just checking the `ref_count` and doing *something*. The\nstandard library's stance is to just abort, because your program has become\nhorribly degenerate. Also *oh my gosh* it's such a ridiculous corner case.\n\n## thread::scoped::JoinGuard\n\n> Note: This API has already been removed from std, for more information\n> you may refer [issue #24292](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24292).\n>\n> This section remains here because we think this example is still\n> important, regardless of whether it is part of std or not.\n\nThe thread::scoped API intended to allow threads to be spawned that reference\ndata on their parent's stack without any synchronization over that data by\nensuring the parent joins the thread before any of the shared data goes out\nof scope.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\npub fn scoped<'a, F>(f: F) -> JoinGuard<'a>\n    where F: FnOnce() + Send + 'a\n```\n\nHere `f` is some closure for the other thread to execute. Saying that\n`F: Send + 'a` is saying that it closes over data that lives for `'a`, and it\neither owns that data or the data was Sync (implying `&data` is Send).\n\nBecause JoinGuard has a lifetime, it keeps all the data it closes over\nborrowed in the parent thread. This means the JoinGuard can't outlive\nthe data that the other thread is working on. When the JoinGuard *does* get\ndropped it blocks the parent thread, ensuring the child terminates before any\nof the closed-over data goes out of scope in the parent.\n\nUsage looked like:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet mut data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n{\n    let mut guards = vec![];\n    for x in &mut data {\n        // Move the mutable reference into the closure, and execute\n        // it on a different thread. The closure has a lifetime bound\n        // by the lifetime of the mutable reference `x` we store in it.\n        // The guard that is returned is in turn assigned the lifetime\n        // of the closure, so it also mutably borrows `data` as `x` did.\n        // This means we cannot access `data` until the guard goes away.\n        let guard = thread::scoped(move || {\n            *x *= 2;\n        });\n        // store the thread's guard for later\n        guards.push(guard);\n    }\n    // All guards are dropped here, forcing the threads to join\n    // (this thread blocks here until the others terminate).\n    // Once the threads join, the borrow expires and the data becomes\n    // accessible again in this thread.\n}\n// data is definitely mutated here.\n```\n\nIn principle, this totally works! Rust's ownership system perfectly ensures it!\n...except it relies on a destructor being called to be safe.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet mut data = Box::new(0);\n{\n    let guard = thread::scoped(|| {\n        // This is at best a data race. At worst, it's also a use-after-free.\n        *data += 1;\n    });\n    // Because the guard is forgotten, expiring the loan without blocking this\n    // thread.\n    mem::forget(guard);\n}\n// So the Box is dropped here while the scoped thread may or may not be trying\n// to access it.\n```\n\nDang. Here the destructor running was pretty fundamental to the API, and it had\nto be scrapped in favor of a completely different design.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::leaking","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"leaking","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Leaking","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"5c4c933fb075b5f45e10d0fb78fe4897418e318be7a36a81aaff14805e3523e3","sig":"zbt6qhcyGh5Ugmz+Z32U6XrPwuCHJVsTPm8O5DKZKpYWbUy+Mo7ChNvo4rYsj0nW5pwuoxrGe6iETuEIkZQZDA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nIn order to make common patterns more ergonomic, Rust allows lifetimes to be\n*elided* in function signatures.\n\nA *lifetime position* is anywhere you can write a lifetime in a type:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\n&'a T\n&'a mut T\nT<'a>\n```\n\nLifetime positions can appear as either \"input\" or \"output\":\n\n* For `fn` definitions, `fn` types, and the traits `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`,\n  input refers to the types of the formal arguments, while output refers to\n  result types. So `fn foo(s: &str) -> (&str, &str)` has elided one lifetime in\n  input position and two lifetimes in output position. Note that the input\n  positions of a `fn` method definition do not include the lifetimes that occur\n  in the method's `impl` header (nor lifetimes that occur in the trait header,\n  for a default method).\n\n* For `impl` headers, all types are input. So `impl Trait<&T> for Struct<&T>`\n  has elided two lifetimes in input position, while `impl Struct<&T>` has elided\n  one.\n\nElision rules are as follows:\n\n* Each elided lifetime in input position becomes a distinct lifetime\n  parameter.\n\n* If there is exactly one input lifetime position (elided or not), that lifetime\n  is assigned to *all* elided output lifetimes.\n\n* If there are multiple input lifetime positions, but one of them is `&self` or\n  `&mut self`, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to *all* elided output lifetimes.\n\n* Otherwise, it is an error to elide an output lifetime.\n\nExamples:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn print(s: &str);                                      // elided\nfn print<'a>(s: &'a str);                               // expanded\n\nfn debug(lvl: usize, s: &str);                          // elided\nfn debug<'a>(lvl: usize, s: &'a str);                   // expanded\n\nfn substr(s: &str, until: usize) -> &str;               // elided\nfn substr<'a>(s: &'a str, until: usize) -> &'a str;     // expanded\n\nfn get_str() -> &str;                                   // ILLEGAL\n\nfn frob(s: &str, t: &str) -> &str;                      // ILLEGAL\n\nfn get_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T;                        // elided\nfn get_mut<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut T;              // expanded\n\nfn args<T: ToCStr>(&mut self, args: &[T]) -> &mut Command                  // elided\nfn args<'a, 'b, T: ToCStr>(&'a mut self, args: &'b [T]) -> &'a mut Command // expanded\n\nfn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> BufWriter;                    // elided\nfn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> BufWriter<'_>;                // elided (with `rust_2018_idioms`)\nfn new<'a>(buf: &'a mut [u8]) -> BufWriter<'a>          // expanded\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::lifetime-elision","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"lifetime-elision","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Lifetime Elision","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"1c683ee2694a6d22d5aebd02d03c22725e2baaa542993f163b79f731cb8e2ce2","sig":"N9t3+G+C+TfJ28vU1DsAxRIOhsfpvocwb21a/GD0ePixi8uFT46PO/SB8UGIoj5CvdDl5YvtmEiOUxDy+RHjCA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nGiven the following code:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Foo;\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn mutate_and_share(&mut self) -> &Self { &*self }\n    fn share(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut foo = Foo;\n    let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();\n    foo.share();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", loan);\n}\n```\n\nOne might expect it to compile. We call `mutate_and_share`, which mutably\nborrows `foo` temporarily, but then returns only a shared reference. Therefore\nwe would expect `foo.share()` to succeed as `foo` shouldn't be mutably borrowed.\n\nHowever when we try to compile it:\n\n```text\nerror[E0502]: cannot borrow `foo` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable\n  --> src/main.rs:12:5\n   |\n11 |     let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();\n   |                --- mutable borrow occurs here\n12 |     foo.share();\n   |     ^^^ immutable borrow occurs here\n13 |     println!(\"{:?}\", loan);\n```\n\nWhat happened? Well, we got the exact same reasoning as we did for\n[Example 2 in the previous section][ex2]. We desugar the program and we get\nthe following:\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\nstruct Foo;\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn mutate_and_share<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a Self { &'a *self }\n    fn share<'a>(&'a self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    'b: {\n        let mut foo: Foo = Foo;\n        'c: {\n            let loan: &'c Foo = Foo::mutate_and_share::<'c>(&'c mut foo);\n            'd: {\n                Foo::share::<'d>(&'d foo);\n            }\n            println!(\"{:?}\", loan);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe lifetime system is forced to extend the `&mut foo` to have lifetime `'c`,\ndue to the lifetime of `loan` and `mutate_and_share`'s signature. Then when we\ntry to call `share`, it sees we're trying to alias that `&'c mut foo` and\nblows up in our face!\n\nThis program is clearly correct according to the reference semantics we actually\ncare about, but the lifetime system is too coarse-grained to handle that.\n\n## Improperly reduced borrows\n\nThe following code fails to compile, because Rust sees that a variable, `map`,\nis borrowed twice, and can not infer that the first borrow ceases to be needed\nbefore the second one occurs. This is caused by Rust conservatively falling back\nto using a whole scope for the first borrow. This will eventually get fixed.\n\n```rust,compile_fail\n# use std::collections::HashMap;\n# use std::hash::Hash;\nfn get_default<'m, K, V>(map: &'m mut HashMap<K, V>, key: K) -> &'m mut V\nwhere\n    K: Clone + Eq + Hash,\n    V: Default,\n{\n    match map.get_mut(&key) {\n        Some(value) => value,\n        None => {\n            map.insert(key.clone(), V::default());\n            map.get_mut(&key).unwrap()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBecause of the lifetime restrictions imposed, `&mut map`'s lifetime\noverlaps other mutable borrows, resulting in a compile error:\n\n```text\nerror[E0499]: cannot borrow `*map` as mutable more than once at a time\n  --> src/main.rs:12:13\n   |\n4  |   fn get_default<'m, K, V>(map: &'m mut HashMap<K, V>, key: K) -> &'m mut V\n   |                  -- lifetime `'m` defined here\n...\n9  |       match map.get_mut(&key) {\n   |       -     --- first mutable borrow occurs here\n   |  _____|\n   | |\n10 | |         Some(value) => value,\n11 | |         None => {\n12 | |             map.insert(key.clone(), V::default());\n   | |             ^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here\n13 | |             map.get_mut(&key).unwrap()\n14 | |         }\n15 | |     }\n   | |_____- returning this value requires that `*map` is borrowed for `'m`\n```\n\n[ex2]: lifetimes.html#example-aliasing-a-mutable-reference","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::lifetime-mismatch","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"lifetime-mismatch","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["aliasing","arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Limits of Lifetimes","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"a875e47b09a3bc1469792c2eecc64a7e7f4f6e41ac21cdded38886607d081e6e","sig":"DJJyqoauO2oh5lklkbO/esLKMefJ0Bc94ZSD+KS5DqCzfG1GOlzJeDXLtwrs0b/O1wjFKTnOiCIu/issOzrQCw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nRust enforces these rules through *lifetimes*. Lifetimes are named\nregions of code that a reference must be valid for. Those regions\nmay be fairly complex, as they correspond to paths of execution\nin the program. There may even be holes in these paths of execution,\nas it's possible to invalidate a reference as long as it's reinitialized\nbefore it's used again. Types which contain references (or pretend to)\nmay also be tagged with lifetimes so that Rust can prevent them from\nbeing invalidated as well.\n\nIn most of our examples, the lifetimes will coincide with scopes. This is\nbecause our examples are simple. The more complex cases where they don't\ncoincide are described below.\n\nWithin a function body, Rust generally doesn't let you explicitly name the\nlifetimes involved. This is because it's generally not really necessary\nto talk about lifetimes in a local context; Rust has all the information and\ncan work out everything as optimally as possible. Many anonymous scopes and\ntemporaries that you would otherwise have to write are often introduced to\nmake your code Just Work.\n\nHowever once you cross the function boundary, you need to start talking about\nlifetimes. Lifetimes are denoted with an apostrophe: `'a`, `'static`. To dip\nour toes with lifetimes, we're going to pretend that we're actually allowed\nto label scopes with lifetimes, and desugar the examples from the start of\nthis chapter.\n\nOriginally, our examples made use of *aggressive* sugar -- high fructose corn\nsyrup even -- around scopes and lifetimes, because writing everything out\nexplicitly is *extremely noisy*. All Rust code relies on aggressive inference\nand elision of \"obvious\" things.\n\nOne particularly interesting piece of sugar is that each `let` statement\nimplicitly introduces a scope. For the most part, this doesn't really matter.\nHowever it does matter for variables that refer to each other. As a simple\nexample, let's completely desugar this simple piece of Rust code:\n\n```rust\nlet x = 0;\nlet y = &x;\nlet z = &y;\n```\n\nThe borrow checker always tries to minimize the extent of a lifetime, so it will\nlikely desugar to the following:\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\n// NOTE: `'a: {` and `&'b x` is not valid syntax!\n'a: {\n    let x: i32 = 0;\n    'b: {\n        // lifetime used is 'b because that's good enough.\n        let y: &'b i32 = &'b x;\n        'c: {\n            // ditto on 'c\n            let z: &'c &'b i32 = &'c y; // \"a reference to a reference to an i32\" (with lifetimes annotated)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWow. That's... awful. Let's all take a moment to thank Rust for making this easier.\n\nActually passing references to outer scopes will cause Rust to infer\na larger lifetime:\n\n```rust\nlet x = 0;\nlet z;\nlet y = &x;\nz = y;\n```\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\n'a: {\n    let x: i32 = 0;\n    'b: {\n        let z: &'b i32;\n        'c: {\n            // Must use 'b here because the reference to x is\n            // being passed to the scope 'b.\n            let y: &'b i32 = &'b x;\n            z = y;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Example: references that outlive referents\n\nAlright, let's look at some of those examples from before:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nfn as_str(data: &u32) -> &str {\n    let s = format!(\"{}\", data);\n    &s\n}\n```\n\ndesugars to:\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str {\n    'b: {\n        let s = format!(\"{}\", data);\n        return &'a s;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis signature of `as_str` takes a reference to a u32 with *some* lifetime, and\npromises that it can produce a reference to a str that can live *just as long*.\nAlready we can see why this signature might be trouble. That basically implies\nthat we're going to find a str somewhere in the scope the reference\nto the u32 originated in, or somewhere *even earlier*. That's a bit of a tall\norder.\n\nWe then proceed to compute the string `s`, and return a reference to it. Since\nthe contract of our function says the reference must outlive `'a`, that's the\nlifetime we infer for the reference. Unfortunately, `s` was defined in the\nscope `'b`, so the only way this is sound is if `'b` contains `'a` -- which is\nclearly false since `'a` must contain the function call itself. We have therefore\ncreated a reference whose lifetime outlives its referent, which is *literally*\nthe first thing we said that references can't do. The compiler rightfully blows\nup in our face.\n\nTo make this more clear, we can expand the example:\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str {\n    'b: {\n        let s = format!(\"{}\", data);\n        return &'a s\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    'c: {\n        let x: u32 = 0;\n        'd: {\n            // An anonymous scope is introduced because the borrow does not\n            // need to last for the whole scope x is valid for. The return\n            // of as_str must find a str somewhere before this function\n            // call. Obviously not happening.\n            println!(\"{}\", as_str::<'d>(&'d x));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nShoot!\n\nOf course, the right way to write this function is as follows:\n\n```rust\nfn to_string(data: &u32) -> String {\n    format!(\"{}\", data)\n}\n```\n\nWe must produce an owned value inside the function to return it! The only way\nwe could have returned an `&'a str` would have been if it was in a field of the\n`&'a u32`, which is obviously not the case.\n\n(Actually we could have also just returned a string literal, which as a global\ncan be considered to reside at the bottom of the stack; though this limits\nour implementation *just a bit*.)\n\n## Example: aliasing a mutable reference\n\nHow about the other example:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nlet mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet x = &data[0];\ndata.push(4);\nprintln!(\"{}\", x);\n```\n\n<!-- ignore: desugared code -->\n```rust,ignore\n'a: {\n    let mut data: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];\n    'b: {\n        // 'b is as big as we need this borrow to be\n        // (just need to get to `println!`)\n        let x: &'b i32 = Index::index::<'b>(&'b data, 0);\n        'c: {\n            // Temporary scope because we don't need the\n            // &mut to last any longer.\n            Vec::push(&'c mut data, 4);\n        }\n        println!(\"{}\", x);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe problem here is a bit more subtle and interesting. We want Rust to\nreject this program for the following reason: We have a live shared reference `x`\nto a descendant of `data` when we try to take a mutable reference to `data`\nto `push`. This would create an aliased mutable reference, which would\nviolate the *second* rule of references.\n\nHowever this is *not at all* how Rust reasons that this program is bad. Rust\ndoesn't understand that `x` is a reference to a subpath of `data`. It doesn't\nunderstand `Vec` at all. What it *does* see is that `x` has to live for `'b` in\norder to be printed. The signature of `Index::index` subsequently demands that\nthe reference we take to `data` has to survive for `'b`. When we try to call\n`push`, it then sees us try to make an `&'c mut data`. Rust knows that `'c` is\ncontained within `'b`, and rejects our program because the `&'b data` must still\nbe alive!\n\nHere we see that the lifetime system is much more coarse than the reference\nsemantics we're actually interested in preserving. For the most part, *that's\ntotally ok*, because it keeps us from spending all day explaining our program\nto the compiler. However it does mean that several programs that are totally\ncorrect with respect to Rust's *true* semantics are rejected because lifetimes\nare too dumb.\n\n## The area covered by a lifetime\n\nA reference (sometimes called a *borrow*) is *alive* from the place it is\ncreated to its last use. The borrowed value needs to outlive only borrows that\nare alive. This looks simple, but there are a few subtleties.\n\nThe following snippet compiles, because after printing `x`, it is no longer\nneeded, so it doesn't matter if it is dangling or aliased (even though the\nvariable `x` *technically* exists to the very end of the scope).\n\n```rust\nlet mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet x = &data[0];\nprintln!(\"{}\", x);\n// This is OK, x is no longer needed\ndata.push(4);\n```\n\nHowever, if the value has a destructor, the destructor is run at the end of the\nscope. And running the destructor is considered a use ‒ obviously the last one.\nSo, this will *not* compile.\n\n```rust,compile_fail\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct X<'a>(&'a i32);\n\nimpl Drop for X<'_> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {}\n}\n\nlet mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet x = X(&data[0]);\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", x);\ndata.push(4);\n// Here, the destructor is run and therefore this'll fail to compile.\n```\n\nOne way to convince the compiler that `x` is no longer valid is by using `drop(x)` before `data.push(4)`.\n\nFurthermore, there might be multiple possible last uses of the borrow, for\nexample in each branch of a condition.\n\n```rust\n# fn some_condition() -> bool { true }\nlet mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\nlet x = &data[0];\n\nif some_condition() {\n    println!(\"{}\", x); // This is the last use of `x` in this branch\n    data.push(4);      // So we can push here\n} else {\n    // There's no use of `x` in here, so effectively the last use is the\n    // creation of x at the top of the example.\n    data.push(5);\n}\n```\n\nAnd a lifetime can have a pause in it. Or you might look at it as two distinct\nborrows just being tied to the same local variable. This often happens around\nloops (writing a new value of a variable at the end of the loop and using it for\nthe last time at the top of the next iteration).\n\n```rust\nlet mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\n// This mut allows us to change where the reference points to\nlet mut x = &data[0];\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", x); // Last use of this borrow\ndata.push(4);\nx = &data[3]; // We start a new borrow here\nprintln!(\"{}\", x);\n```\n\nHistorically, Rust kept the borrow alive until the end of scope, so these\nexamples might fail to compile with older compilers. Also, there are still some\ncorner cases where Rust fails to properly shorten the live part of the borrow\nand fails to compile even when it looks like it should. These'll be solved over\ntime.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::lifetimes","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"lifetimes","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["aliasing","arc_pitfalls","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Lifetimes","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"8c63987cbf81b15fcf5610b627a46c122030f281361be3d87432137702f574c4","sig":"VqLhwflAepNkmOW8iIDbIkPoP5dJKs6XJACgwk1w5suKLI6mTv4jcnWg+7O2D8nxi/C0gRZnu1i189EIHPoaCg==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\n![safe and unsafe](img/safeandunsafe.svg)\n\nIt would be great to not have to worry about low-level implementation details.\nWho could possibly care how much space the empty tuple occupies? Sadly, it\nsometimes matters and we need to worry about it. The most common reason\ndevelopers start to care about implementation details is performance, but more\nimportantly, these details can become a matter of correctness when interfacing\ndirectly with hardware, operating systems, or other languages.\n\nWhen implementation details start to matter in a safe programming language,\nprogrammers usually have three options:\n\n* fiddle with the code to encourage the compiler/runtime to perform an optimization\n* adopt a more unidiomatic or cumbersome design to get the desired implementation\n* rewrite the implementation in a language that lets you deal with those details\n\nFor that last option, the language programmers tend to use is *C*. This is often\nnecessary to interface with systems that only declare a C interface.\n\nUnfortunately, C is incredibly unsafe to use (sometimes for good reason),\nand this unsafety is magnified when trying to interoperate with another\nlanguage. Care must be taken to ensure C and the other language agree on\nwhat's happening, and that they don't step on each other's toes.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Rust?\n\nWell, unlike C, Rust is a safe programming language.\n\nBut, like C, Rust is an unsafe programming language.\n\nMore accurately, Rust *contains* both a safe and unsafe programming language.\n\nRust can be thought of as a combination of two programming languages: *Safe\nRust* and *Unsafe Rust*. Conveniently, these names mean exactly what they say:\nSafe Rust is Safe. Unsafe Rust is, well, not. In fact, Unsafe Rust lets us\ndo some *really* unsafe things. Things the Rust authors will implore you not to\ndo, but we'll do anyway.\n\nSafe Rust is the *true* Rust programming language. If all you do is write Safe\nRust, you will never have to worry about type-safety or memory-safety. You will\nnever endure a dangling pointer, a use-after-free, or any other kind of\nUndefined Behavior (a.k.a. UB).\n\nThe standard library also gives you enough utilities out of the box that you'll\nbe able to write high-performance applications and libraries in pure idiomatic\nSafe Rust.\n\nBut maybe you want to talk to another language. Maybe you're writing a\nlow-level abstraction not exposed by the standard library. Maybe you're\n*writing* the standard library (which is written entirely in Rust). Maybe you\nneed to do something the type-system doesn't understand and just *frob some dang\nbits*. Maybe you need Unsafe Rust.\n\nUnsafe Rust is exactly like Safe Rust with all the same rules and semantics.\nIt just lets you do some *extra* things that are Definitely Not Safe\n(which we will define in the next section).\n\nThe value of this separation is that we gain the benefits of using an unsafe\nlanguage like C — low level control over implementation details — without most\nof the problems that come with trying to integrate it with a completely\ndifferent safe language.\n\nThere are still some problems — most notably, we must become aware of properties\nthat the type system assumes and audit them in any code that interacts with\nUnsafe Rust. That's the purpose of this book: to teach you about these assumptions\nand how to manage them.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::meet-safe-and-unsafe","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"meet-safe-and-unsafe","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Meet Safe and Unsafe","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"580c36a795c6a4223c0d18806bfb089f3cd88c2406e69d879b668268fc5ba5b8","sig":"TcSoNme9jU/esnk1PK6Yj8fdCp2eFqzyl4kXuG1MsduFNqZZm8rIdAF6tB92+ZeNrB9VzO2rCwF/OV/TKwEAAw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Especially if you use the standard library.\n\nRoughly speaking the pattern is as follows: to acquire a resource, you create an\nobject that manages it. To release the resource, you simply destroy the object,\nand it cleans up the resource for you. The most common \"resource\" this pattern\nmanages is simply *memory*. `Box`, `Rc`, and basically everything in\n`std::collections` is a convenience to enable correctly managing memory. This is\nparticularly important in Rust because we have no pervasive GC to rely on for\nmemory management. Which is the point, really: Rust is about control.

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nRust allows you to specify alternative data layout strategies from the default.\nThere's also the [unsafe code guidelines] (note that it's **NOT** normative).\n\n## repr(C)\n\nThis is the most important `repr`. It has fairly simple intent: do what C does.\nThe order, size, and alignment of fields is exactly what you would expect from C\nor C++. The type is also passed across `extern \"C\"` function call boundaries the\nsame way C would pass the corresponding type. Any type you expect to pass through an FFI boundary should have\n`repr(C)`, as C is the lingua-franca of the programming world. This is also\nnecessary to soundly do more elaborate tricks with data layout such as\nreinterpreting values as a different type.\n\nWe strongly recommend using [rust-bindgen] and/or [cbindgen] to manage your FFI\nboundaries for you. The Rust team works closely with those projects to ensure\nthat they work robustly and are compatible with current and future guarantees\nabout type layouts and `repr`s.\n\nThe interaction of `repr(C)` with Rust's more exotic data layout features must be\nkept in mind. Due to its dual purpose as \"for FFI\" and \"for layout control\",\n`repr(C)` can be applied to types that will be nonsensical or problematic if\npassed through the FFI boundary.\n\n* ZSTs are still zero-sized, even though this is not a standard behavior in\nC, and is explicitly contrary to the behavior of an empty type in C++, which\nsays they should still consume a byte of space.\n\n* DST pointers (wide pointers) and tuples are not a concept\n  in C, and as such are never FFI-safe.\n\n* Enums with fields also aren't a concept in C or C++, but a valid bridging\n  of the types [is defined][really-tagged].\n\n* If `T` is an [FFI-safe non-nullable pointer\n  type](ffi.html#the-nullable-pointer-optimization),\n  `Option<T>` is guaranteed to have the same layout and ABI as `T` and is\n  therefore also FFI-safe. As of this writing, this covers `&`, `&mut`,\n  and function pointers, all of which can never be null.\n\n* Tuple structs are like structs with regards to `repr(C)`, as the only\n  difference from a struct is that the fields aren’t named.\n\n* `repr(C)` is equivalent to one of `repr(u*)` (see the next section) for\nfieldless enums. The chosen size and sign is the default enum size and sign for the target platform's C\napplication binary interface (ABI). Note that enum representation in C is implementation\ndefined, so this is really a \"best guess\". In particular, this may be incorrect\nwhen the C code of interest is compiled with certain flags.\n\n* Fieldless enums with `repr(C)` or `repr(u*)` still may not be set to an\ninteger value without a corresponding variant, even though this is\npermitted behavior in C or C++. It is undefined behavior to (unsafely)\nconstruct an instance of an enum that does not match one of its\nvariants. (This allows exhaustive matches to continue to be written and\ncompiled as normal.)\n\n## repr(transparent)\n\n`#[repr(transparent)]` can only be used on a struct or single-variant enum that has a single non-zero-sized field (there may be additional zero-sized fields).\nThe effect is that the layout and ABI of the whole struct/enum is guaranteed to be the same as that one field.\n\n> NOTE: There's a `transparent_unions` nightly feature to apply `repr(transparent)` to unions,\n> but it hasn't been stabilized due to design concerns. See the [tracking issue][issue-60405] for more details.\n\nThe goal is to make it possible to transmute between the single field and the\nstruct/enum. An example of that is [`UnsafeCell`], which can be transmuted into\nthe type it wraps ([`UnsafeCell`] also uses the unstable [no_niche][no-niche-pull],\nso its ABI is not actually guaranteed to be the same when nested in other types).\n\nAlso, passing the struct/enum through FFI where the inner field type is expected on\nthe other side is guaranteed to work. In particular, this is necessary for\n`struct Foo(f32)` or `enum Foo { Bar(f32) }` to always have the same ABI as `f32`.\n\nThis repr is only considered part of the public ABI of a type if either the single\nfield is `pub`, or if its layout is documented in prose. Otherwise, the layout should\nnot be relied upon by other crates.\n\nMore details are in the [RFC 1758][rfc-transparent] and the [RFC 2645][rfc-transparent-unions-enums].\n\n## repr(u*), repr(i*)\n\nThese specify the size and sign to make a fieldless enum. If the discriminant overflows\nthe integer it has to fit in, it will produce a compile-time error. You can\nmanually ask Rust to allow this by setting the overflowing element to explicitly\nbe 0. However Rust will not allow you to create an enum where two variants have\nthe same discriminant.\n\nThe term \"fieldless enum\" only means that the enum doesn't have data in any\nof its variants. A fieldless enum without a `repr` is\nstill a Rust native type, and does not have a stable layout or representation.\nAdding a `repr(u*)`/`repr(i*)` causes it to be treated exactly like the specified\ninteger type for layout purposes (except that the compiler will still exploit its\nknowledge of \"invalid\" values at this type to optimize enum layout, such as when\nthis enum is wrapped in `Option`). Note that the function call ABI for these\ntypes is still in general unspecified, except that across `extern \"C\"` calls they\nare ABI-compatible with C enums of the same sign and size.\n\nIf the enum has fields, the effect is similar to the effect of `repr(C)`\nin that there is a defined layout of the type. This makes it possible to\npass the enum to C code, or access the type's raw representation and directly\nmanipulate its tag and fields. See [the RFC][really-tagged] for details.\n\nThese `repr`s have no effect on a struct.\n\nAdding an explicit `repr(u*)`, `repr(i*)`, or `repr(C)` to an enum with fields suppresses the null-pointer optimization, like:\n\n```rust\n# use std::mem::size_of;\nenum MyOption<T> {\n    Some(T),\n    None,\n}\n\n#[repr(u8)]\nenum MyReprOption<T> {\n    Some(T),\n    None,\n}\n\nassert_eq!(8, size_of::<MyOption<&u16>>());\nassert_eq!(16, size_of::<MyReprOption<&u16>>());\n```\n\nThis optimization still applies to fieldless enums with an explicit `repr(u*)`, `repr(i*)`, or `repr(C)`.\n\n## repr(packed), repr(packed(n))\n\n`repr(packed(n))` (where `n` is a power of two) forces the type to have an\nalignment of *at most* `n`. Most commonly used without an explicit `n`,\n`repr(packed)` is equivalent to `repr(packed(1))` which forces Rust to strip\nany padding, and only align the type to a byte. This may improve the memory\nfootprint, but will likely have other negative side-effects.\n\nIn particular, most architectures *strongly* prefer values to be naturally\naligned. This may mean that unaligned loads are penalized (x86), or even fault\n(some ARM chips). For simple cases like directly loading or storing a packed\nfield, the compiler might be able to paper over alignment issues with shifts\nand masks. However if you take a reference to a packed field, it's unlikely\nthat the compiler will be able to emit code to avoid an unaligned load.\n\n[As this can cause undefined behavior][ub loads], the lint has been implemented\nand it will become a hard error.\n\n`repr(packed)/repr(packed(n))` is not to be used lightly. Unless you have\nextreme requirements, this should not be used.\n\nThis repr is a modifier on `repr(C)` and `repr(Rust)`. For FFI compatibility\nyou most likely always want to be explicit: `repr(C, packed)`.\n\n## repr(align(n))\n\n`repr(align(n))` (where `n` is a power of two) forces the type to have an\nalignment of *at least* `n`.\n\nThis enables several tricks, like making sure neighboring elements of an array\nnever share the same cache line with each other (which may speed up certain\nkinds of concurrent code).\n\nThis is a modifier on `repr(C)` and `repr(Rust)`. It is incompatible with\n`repr(packed)`.\n\n[unsafe code guidelines]: https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/layout.html\n[drop flags]: drop-flags.html\n[ub loads]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060\n[issue-60405]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60405\n[`UnsafeCell`]: ../std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html\n[rfc-transparent]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1758-repr-transparent.md\n[rfc-transparent-unions-enums]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2645-transparent-unions.html\n[really-tagged]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2195-really-tagged-unions.md\n[rust-bindgen]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/\n[cbindgen]: https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen\n[no-niche-pull]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68491","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::other-reprs","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"other-reprs","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Alternative representations","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"ba413958c72db6c2451e20250c049ff0a490951dafc2528ae4ceb779b9ee76bd","sig":"bdzlalZ+j6t8ro3vA22JxxnbVgxkAtu17YHYIILr/BM+/Q6kj5zaq5jJryt/h6KWJRCys4O8srqP99b93EuUDA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nOwnership is the breakout feature of Rust. It allows Rust to be completely\nmemory-safe and efficient, while avoiding garbage collection. Before getting\ninto the ownership system in detail, we will consider the motivation of this\ndesign.\n\nWe will assume that you accept that garbage collection (GC) is not always an\noptimal solution, and that it is desirable to manually manage memory in some\ncontexts. If you do not accept this, might I interest you in a different\nlanguage?\n\nRegardless of your feelings on GC, it is pretty clearly a *massive* boon to\nmaking code safe. You never have to worry about things going away *too soon*\n(although whether you still wanted to be pointing at that thing is a different\nissue...). This is a pervasive problem that C and C++ programs need to deal\nwith. Consider this simple mistake that all of us who have used a non-GC'd\nlanguage have made at one point:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nfn as_str(data: &u32) -> &str {\n    // compute the string\n    let s = format!(\"{}\", data);\n\n    // OH NO! We returned a reference to something that\n    // exists only in this function!\n    // Dangling pointer! Use after free! Alas!\n    // (this does not compile in Rust)\n    &s\n}\n```\n\nThis is exactly what Rust's ownership system was built to solve.\nRust knows the scope in which the `&s` lives, and as such can prevent it from\nescaping. However this is a simple case that even a C compiler could plausibly\ncatch. Things get more complicated as code gets bigger and pointers get fed through\nvarious functions. Eventually, a C compiler will fall down and won't be able to\nperform sufficient escape analysis to prove your code unsound. It will consequently\nbe forced to accept your program on the assumption that it is correct.\n\nThis will never happen to Rust. It's up to the programmer to prove to the\ncompiler that everything is sound.\n\nOf course, Rust's story around ownership is much more complicated than just\nverifying that references don't escape the scope of their referent. That's\nbecause ensuring pointers are always valid is much more complicated than this.\nFor instance in this code,\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nlet mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\n// get an internal reference\nlet x = &data[0];\n\n// OH NO! `push` causes the backing storage of `data` to be reallocated.\n// Dangling pointer! Use after free! Alas!\n// (this does not compile in Rust)\ndata.push(4);\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", x);\n```\n\nnaive scope analysis would be insufficient to prevent this bug, because `data`\ndoes in fact live as long as we needed. However it was *changed* while we had\na reference into it. This is why Rust requires any references to freeze the\nreferent and its owners.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::ownership","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"ownership","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Ownership and Lifetimes","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"0a831c6c3d6feca62ea5d43f870656e2df41468b4e9e67327647da2f944c05fd","sig":"RkowH/3/Hn5iPHEONEl5lGJLT5FF3x1OHVwhsLAQ6+KTg7pR7+VhjQQ0ns+cFUDtKsIHokAQCKrTBOD9kJLbCQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nWhen working with unsafe code, we can often end up in a situation where\ntypes or lifetimes are logically associated with a struct, but not actually\npart of a field. This most commonly occurs with lifetimes. For instance, the\n`Iter` for `&'a [T]` is (approximately) defined as follows:\n\n```rust,compile_fail\nstruct Iter<'a, T: 'a> {\n    ptr: *const T,\n    end: *const T,\n}\n```\n\nHowever because `'a` is unused within the struct's body, it's *unbounded*.\n[Because of the troubles this has historically caused][unused-param],\nunbounded lifetimes and types are *forbidden* in struct definitions.\nTherefore we must somehow refer to these types in the body.\nCorrectly doing this is necessary to have correct variance and drop checking.\n\n[unused-param]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0738-variance.html#the-corner-case-unused-parameters-and-parameters-that-are-only-used-unsafely\n\nWe do this using `PhantomData`, which is a special marker type. `PhantomData`\nconsumes no space, but simulates a field of the given type for the purpose of\nstatic analysis. This was deemed to be less error-prone than explicitly telling\nthe type-system the kind of variance that you want, while also providing other\nuseful things such as auto traits and the information needed by drop check.\n\nIter logically contains a bunch of `&'a T`s, so this is exactly what we tell\nthe `PhantomData` to simulate:\n\n```rust\nuse std::marker;\n\nstruct Iter<'a, T: 'a> {\n    ptr: *const T,\n    end: *const T,\n    _marker: marker::PhantomData<&'a T>,\n}\n```\n\nand that's it. The lifetime will be bounded, and your iterator will be covariant\nover `'a` and `T`. Everything Just Works.\n\n## Generic parameters and drop-checking\n\nIn the past, there used to be another thing to take into consideration.\n\nThis very documentation used to say:\n\n> Another important example is Vec, which is (approximately) defined as follows:\n>\n> ```rust\n> struct Vec<T> {\n>     data: *const T, // *const for variance!\n>     len: usize,\n>     cap: usize,\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Unlike the previous example, it *appears* that everything is exactly as we\n> want. Every generic argument to Vec shows up in at least one field.\n> Good to go!\n>\n> Nope.\n>\n> The drop checker will generously determine that `Vec<T>` does not own any values\n> of type T. This will in turn make it conclude that it doesn't need to worry\n> about Vec dropping any T's in its destructor for determining drop check\n> soundness. This will in turn allow people to create unsoundness using\n> Vec's destructor.\n>\n> In order to tell the drop checker that we *do* own values of type T, and\n> therefore may drop some T's when *we* drop, we must add an extra `PhantomData`\n> saying exactly that:\n>\n> ```rust\n> use std::marker;\n>\n> struct Vec<T> {\n>     data: *const T, // *const for variance!\n>     len: usize,\n>     cap: usize,\n>     _owns_T: marker::PhantomData<T>,\n> }\n> ```\n\nBut ever since [RFC 1238](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1238-nonparametric-dropck.html),\n**this is no longer true nor necessary**.\n\nIf you were to write:\n\n```rust\nstruct Vec<T> {\n    data: *const T, // `*const` for variance!\n    len: usize,\n    cap: usize,\n}\n\n# #[cfg(any())]\nimpl<T> Drop for Vec<T> { /* … */ }\n```\n\nthen the existence of that `impl<T> Drop for Vec<T>` makes it so Rust will consider\nthat that `Vec<T>` _owns_ values of type `T` (more precisely: may use values of type `T`\nin its `Drop` implementation), and Rust will thus not allow them to _dangle_ should a\n`Vec<T>` be dropped.\n\nWhen a type already has a `Drop impl`, **adding an extra `_owns_T: PhantomData<T>` field\nis thus _superfluous_ and accomplishes nothing**, dropck-wise (it still affects variance\nand auto-traits).\n\n  - (advanced edge case: if the type containing the `PhantomData` has no `Drop` impl at all,\n    but still has drop glue (by having _another_ field with drop glue), then the\n    dropck/`#[may_dangle]` considerations mentioned herein do apply as well: a `PhantomData<T>`\n    field will then require `T` to be droppable whenever the containing type goes out of scope).\n\n___\n\nBut this situation can sometimes lead to overly restrictive code. That's why the\nstandard library uses an unstable and `unsafe` attribute to opt back into the old\n\"unchecked\" drop-checking behavior, that this very documentation warned about: the\n`#[may_dangle]` attribute.\n\n### An exception: the special case of the standard library and its unstable `#[may_dangle]`\n\nThis section can be skipped if you are only writing your own library code; but if you are\ncurious about what the standard library does with the actual `Vec` definition, you'll notice\nthat it still needs to use a `_owns_T: PhantomData<T>` field for soundness.\n\n<details><summary>Click here to see why</summary>\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut v: Vec<&str> = Vec::new();\n    let s: String = \"Short-lived\".into();\n    v.push(&s);\n    drop(s);\n} // <- `v` is dropped here\n```\n\nwith a classical `impl<T> Drop for Vec<T> {` definition, the above [is denied].\n\n[is denied]: https://rust.godbolt.org/z/ans15Kqz3\n\nIndeed, in this case we have a `Vec</* T = */ &'s str>` vector of `'s`-lived references\nto `str`ings, but in the case of `let s: String`, it is dropped before the `Vec` is, and\nthus `'s` **is expired** by the time the `Vec` is dropped, and the\n`impl<'s> Drop for Vec<&'s str> {` is used.\n\nThis means that if such `Drop` were to be used, it would be dealing with an _expired_, or\n_dangling_ lifetime `'s`. But this is contrary to Rust principles, where by default all\nRust references involved in a function signature are non-dangling and valid to dereference.\n\nHence why Rust has to conservatively deny this snippet.\n\nAnd yet, in the case of the real `Vec`, the `Drop` impl does not care about `&'s str`,\n_since it has no drop glue of its own_: it only wants to deallocate the backing buffer.\n\nIn other words, it would be nice if the above snippet was somehow accepted, by special\ncasing `Vec`, or by relying on some special property of `Vec`: `Vec` could try to\n_promise not to use the `&'s str`s it holds when being dropped_.\n\nThis is the kind of `unsafe` promise that can be expressed with `#[may_dangle]`:\n\n```rust ,ignore\nunsafe impl<#[may_dangle] 's> Drop for Vec<&'s str> { /* … */ }\n```\n\nor, more generally:\n\n```rust ,ignore\nunsafe impl<#[may_dangle] T> Drop for Vec<T> { /* … */ }\n```\n\nis the `unsafe` way to opt out of this conservative assumption that Rust's drop\nchecker makes about type parameters of a dropped instance not being allowed to dangle.\n\nAnd when this is done, such as in the standard library, we need to be careful in the\ncase where `T` has drop glue of its own. In this instance, imagine replacing the\n`&'s str`s with a `struct PrintOnDrop<'s> /* = */ (&'s str);` which would have a\n`Drop` impl wherein the inner `&'s str` would be dereferenced and printed to the screen.\n\nIndeed, `Drop for Vec<T> {`, before deallocating the backing buffer, does have to transitively\ndrop each `T` item when it has drop glue; in the case of `PrintOnDrop<'s>`, it means that\n`Drop for Vec<PrintOnDrop<'s>>` has to transitively drop the `PrintOnDrop<'s>`s elements before\ndeallocating the backing buffer.\n\nSo when we said that `'s` `#[may_dangle]`, it was an excessively loose statement. We'd rather want\nto say: \"`'s` may dangle provided it not be involved in some transitive drop glue\". Or, more generally,\n\"`T` may dangle provided it not be involved in some transitive drop glue\". This \"exception to the\nexception\" is a pervasive situation whenever **we own a `T`**. That's why Rust's `#[may_dangle]` is\nsmart enough to know of this opt-out, and will thus be disabled _when the generic parameter is held\nin an owned fashion_ by the fields of the struct.\n\nHence why the standard library ends up with:\n\n```rust\n# #[cfg(any())]\n// we pinky-swear not to use `T` when dropping a `Vec`…\nunsafe impl<#[may_dangle] T> Drop for Vec<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            if mem::needs_drop::<T>() {\n                /* … except here, that is, … */\n                ptr::drop_in_place::<[T]>(/* … */);\n            }\n            // …\n            dealloc(/* … */)\n            // …\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Vec<T> {\n    // … except for the fact that a `Vec` owns `T` items and\n    // may thus be dropping `T` items on drop!\n    _owns_T: core::marker::PhantomData<T>,\n\n    ptr: *const T, // `*const` for variance (but this does not express ownership of a `T` *per se*)\n    len: usize,\n    cap: usize,\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n___\n\nRaw pointers that own an allocation is such a pervasive pattern that the\nstandard library made a utility for itself called `Unique<T>` which:\n\n* wraps a `*const T` for variance\n* includes a `PhantomData<T>`\n* auto-derives `Send`/`Sync` as if T was contained\n* marks the pointer as `NonZero` for the null-pointer optimization\n\n## Table of `PhantomData` patterns\n\nHere’s a table of all the wonderful ways `PhantomData` could be used:\n\n| Phantom type                | variance of `'a` | variance of `T`   | `Send`/`Sync`<br/>(or lack thereof)       | dangling `'a` or `T` in drop glue<br/>(_e.g._, `#[may_dangle] Drop`) |\n|-----------------------------|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|\n| `PhantomData<T>`            | -                | **cov**ariant     | inherited                                 | disallowed (\"owns `T`\")                          |\n| `PhantomData<&'a T>`        | **cov**ariant    | **cov**ariant     | `Send + Sync`<br/>requires<br/>`T : Sync` | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<&'a mut T>`    | **cov**ariant    | **inv**ariant     | inherited                                 | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<*const T>`     | -                | **cov**ariant     | `!Send + !Sync`                           | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<*mut T>`       | -                | **inv**ariant     | `!Send + !Sync`                           | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<fn(T)>`        | -                | **contra**variant | `Send + Sync`                             | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<fn() -> T>`    | -                | **cov**ariant     | `Send + Sync`                             | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<fn(T) -> T>`   | -                | **inv**ariant     | `Send + Sync`                             | allowed                                          |\n| `PhantomData<Cell<&'a ()>>` | **inv**ariant    | -                 | `Send + !Sync`                            | allowed                                          |\n\n  - Note: opting out of the `Unpin` auto-trait requires the dedicated [`PhantomPinned`] type instead.\n\n[`PhantomPinned`]: ../core/marker/struct.PhantomPinned.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::phantom-data","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"phantom-data","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","soundness","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"PhantomData","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"69176f4b52f8c3f86f999f20afec810ead7b12484a9c69f1a3eed1f7f0e2d393","sig":"01LlxHfEzgwptfILb0PF3zmYoUg1cOB+i/4jFMBI43pEdBnjW8pQX6+nkhDtGxPZ+bUISQ6d7cTAlpgH+vOiDw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nAlthough all unsafe code *must* ensure it has minimal exception safety, not all\ntypes ensure *maximal* exception safety. Even if the type does, your code may\nascribe additional meaning to it. For instance, an integer is certainly\nexception-safe, but has no semantics on its own. It's possible that code that\npanics could fail to correctly update the integer, producing an inconsistent\nprogram state.\n\nThis is *usually* fine, because anything that witnesses an exception is about\nto get destroyed. For instance, if you send a Vec to another thread and that\nthread panics, it doesn't matter if the Vec is in a weird state. It will be\ndropped and go away forever. However some types are especially good at smuggling\nvalues across the panic boundary.\n\nThese types may choose to explicitly *poison* themselves if they witness a panic.\nPoisoning doesn't entail anything in particular. Generally it just means\npreventing normal usage from proceeding. The most notable example of this is the\nstandard library's Mutex type. A Mutex will poison itself if one of its\nMutexGuards (the thing it returns when a lock is obtained) is dropped during a\npanic. Any future attempts to lock the Mutex will return an `Err` or panic.\n\nMutex poisons not for true safety in the sense that Rust normally cares about. It\npoisons as a safety-guard against blindly using the data that comes out of a Mutex\nthat has witnessed a panic while locked. The data in such a Mutex was likely in the\nmiddle of being modified, and as such may be in an inconsistent or incomplete state.\nIt is important to note that one cannot violate memory safety with such a type\nif it is correctly written. After all, it must be minimally exception-safe!\n\nHowever if the Mutex contained, say, a BinaryHeap that does not actually have the\nheap property, it's unlikely that any code that uses it will do\nwhat the author intended. As such, the program should not proceed normally.\nStill, if you're double-plus-sure that you can do *something* with the value,\nthe Mutex exposes a method to get the lock anyway. It *is* safe, after all.\nJust maybe nonsense.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::poisoning","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"poisoning","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","panic","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Poisoning","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"236b73495a4b5442570f2d2d88496968cc3bb7b8acd54afb68be33f7305d8da1","sig":"nRO2BWUF28b8gtGQYyzaVRS0iR8u85CW8gyWJR9KMA5WT8pg5jLZmAi0+Oxvr7rahj9eNeIf9RpOicg19BfYDw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Interior mutability makes this more complicated, which is largely why\nwe have the Send and Sync traits (see the next section for more on this).\n\n**However Rust does not prevent general race conditions.**\n\nThis is mathematically impossible in situations where you do not control the\nscheduler, which is true for the normal OS environment. If you do control\npreemption, it _can be_ possible to prevent general races - this technique is\nused by frameworks such as [RTIC](https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic). However,\nactually having control over scheduling is a very uncommon case.\n\nFor this reason, it is considered \"safe\" for Rust to get deadlocked or do\nsomething nonsensical with incorrect synchronization: this is known as a general\nrace condition or resource race. Obviously such a program isn't very good, but\nRust of course cannot prevent all logic errors.\n\nIn any case, a race condition cannot violate memory safety in a Rust program on\nits own. Only in conjunction with some other unsafe code can a race condition\nactually violate memory safety. For instance, a correct program looks like this:\n\n```rust,no_run\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};\nuse std::sync::Arc;\n\nlet data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n// Arc so that the memory the AtomicUsize is stored in still exists for\n// the other thread to increment, even if we completely finish executing\n// before it. Rust won't compile the program without it, because of the\n// lifetime requirements of thread::spawn!\nlet idx = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0));\nlet other_idx = idx.clone();\n\n// `move` captures other_idx by-value, moving it into this thread\nthread::spawn(move || {\n    // It's ok to mutate idx because this value\n    // is an atomic, so it can't cause a Data Race.\n    other_idx.fetch_add(10, Ordering::SeqCst);\n});\n\n// Index with the value loaded from the atomic. This is safe because we\n// read the atomic memory only once, and then pass a copy of that value\n// to the Vec's indexing implementation. This indexing will be correctly\n// bounds checked, and there's no chance of the value getting changed\n// in the middle. However our program may panic if the thread we spawned\n// managed to increment before this ran. A race condition because correct\n// program execution (panicking is rarely correct) depends on order of\n// thread execution.\nprintln!(\"{}\", data[idx.load(Ordering::SeqCst)]);\n```\n\nWe can cause a race condition to violate memory safety if we instead do the bound\ncheck in advance, and then unsafely access the data with an unchecked value:\n\n```rust,no_run\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};\nuse std::sync::Arc;\n\nlet data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nlet idx = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0));\nlet other_idx = idx.clone();\n\n// `move` captures other_idx by-value, moving it into this thread\nthread::spawn(move || {\n    // It's ok to mutate idx because this value\n    // is an atomic, so it can't cause a Data Race.\n    other_idx.fetch_add(10, Ordering::SeqCst);\n});\n\nif idx.load(Ordering::SeqCst) < data.len() {\n    unsafe {\n        // Incorrectly loading the idx after we did the bounds check.\n        // It could have changed. This is a race condition, *and dangerous*\n        // because we decided to do `get_unchecked`, which is `unsafe`.\n        println!(\"{}\", data.get_unchecked(idx.load(Ordering::SeqCst)));\n    }\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::races","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"races","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","panic","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Data Races and Race Conditions","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"d505af24fa37d780decd7561c42209df748c302e4d249a881868b68891e80e1a","sig":"Dl1QgCZtov5SqCLi3otESDfWie1BaWQkcwjvtp6wacRm0z6WXb+r+JnG5hJdIpyoweY5q8GnQ7vtBf86pTtDBQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nFirst and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2.\n\nPrimitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits).\n\nA type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types][dst].\n\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)\n\nAn enum is said to be *field-less* if none of its variants have associated data.\n\nBy default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```rust\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```rust\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align `b`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```rust\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n```\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default.\nGiven the two following struct definitions:\n\n```rust\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B.\n\nWith A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways.\n\nFor instance, consider this struct:\n\n```rust\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n<!-- ignore: explanation code -->\n```rust,ignore\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*.\n\nEnums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```rust\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```rust\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`).\n\nHowever there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`.\n\nThere are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today.\n\n[dst]: exotic-sizes.html#dynamically-sized-types-dsts","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::repr-rust","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"repr-rust","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"repr(Rust)","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"11cd37c42bdc21140ade4732576fb737a1b5b1e879d83d023a8821cf4e07acf0","sig":"xEUGHmATeVeOqOqK5sSCEEaBljq51ZV/3pdutdb3sA+MGxotgS+4uWnnjHzSZApeqMjZwZlo6nteu07ebTQOBQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nWhat's the relationship between Safe Rust and Unsafe Rust? How do they\ninteract?\n\nThe separation between Safe Rust and Unsafe Rust is controlled with the\n`unsafe` keyword, which acts as an interface from one to the other. This is\nwhy we can say Safe Rust is a safe language: all the unsafe parts are kept\nexclusively behind the `unsafe` boundary. If you wish, you can even toss\n`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` into your code base to statically guarantee that\nyou're only writing Safe Rust.\n\nThe `unsafe` keyword has two uses: to declare the existence of contracts the\ncompiler can't check, and to declare that a programmer has checked that these\ncontracts have been upheld.\n\nYou can use `unsafe` to indicate the existence of unchecked contracts on\n_functions_ and _trait declarations_. On functions, `unsafe` means that\nusers of the function must check that function's documentation to ensure\nthey are using it in a way that maintains the contracts the function\nrequires. On trait declarations, `unsafe` means that implementors of the\ntrait must check the trait documentation to ensure their implementation\nmaintains the contracts the trait requires.\n\nYou can use `unsafe` on a block to declare that all unsafe actions performed\nwithin are verified to uphold the contracts of those operations. For instance,\nthe index passed to [`slice::get_unchecked`][get_unchecked] is in-bounds.\n\nYou can use `unsafe` on a trait implementation to declare that the implementation\nupholds the trait's contract. For instance, that a type implementing [`Send`] is\nreally safe to move to another thread.\n\nThe standard library has a number of unsafe functions, including:\n\n* [`slice::get_unchecked`][get_unchecked], which performs unchecked indexing,\n  allowing memory safety to be freely violated.\n* [`mem::transmute`][transmute] reinterprets some value as having a given type,\n  bypassing type safety in arbitrary ways (see [conversions] for details).\n* Every raw pointer to a sized type has an [`offset`][ptr_offset] method that\n  invokes Undefined Behavior if the passed offset is not [\"in bounds\"][ptr_offset].\n* All FFI (Foreign Function Interface) functions are `unsafe` to call because the\n  other language can do arbitrary operations that the Rust compiler can't check.\n\nAs of Rust 1.29.2 the standard library defines the following unsafe traits\n(there are others, but they are not stabilized yet and some of them may never\nbe):\n\n* [`Send`] is a marker trait (a trait with no API) that promises implementors\n  are safe to send (move) to another thread.\n* [`Sync`] is a marker trait that promises threads can safely share implementors\n  through a shared reference.\n* [`GlobalAlloc`] allows customizing the memory allocator of the whole program.\n\nMuch of the Rust standard library also uses Unsafe Rust internally. These\nimplementations have generally been rigorously manually checked, so the Safe Rust\ninterfaces built on top of these implementations can be assumed to be safe.\n\nThe need for all of this separation boils down a single fundamental property\nof Safe Rust, the *soundness property*:\n\n**No matter what, Safe Rust can't cause Undefined Behavior.**\n\nThe design of the safe/unsafe split means that there is an asymmetric trust\nrelationship between Safe and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust inherently has to\ntrust that any Unsafe Rust it touches has been written correctly.\nOn the other hand, Unsafe Rust cannot trust Safe Rust without care.\n\nAs an example, Rust has the [`PartialOrd`] and [`Ord`] traits to differentiate\nbetween types which can \"just\" be compared, and those that provide a \"total\"\nordering (which basically means that comparison behaves reasonably).\n\n[`BTreeMap`] doesn't really make sense for partially-ordered types, and so it\nrequires that its keys implement `Ord`. However, `BTreeMap` has Unsafe Rust code\ninside of its implementation. Because it would be unacceptable for a sloppy `Ord`\nimplementation (which is Safe to write) to cause Undefined Behavior, the Unsafe\ncode in BTreeMap must be written to be robust against `Ord` implementations which\naren't actually total — even though that's the whole point of requiring `Ord`.\n\nThe Unsafe Rust code just can't trust the Safe Rust code to be written correctly.\nThat said, `BTreeMap` will still behave completely erratically if you feed in\nvalues that don't have a total ordering. It just won't ever cause Undefined\nBehavior.\n\nOne may wonder, if `BTreeMap` cannot trust `Ord` because it's Safe, why can it\ntrust *any* Safe code? For instance `BTreeMap` relies on integers and slices to\nbe implemented correctly. Those are safe too, right?\n\nThe difference is one of scope. When `BTreeMap` relies on integers and slices,\nit's relying on one very specific implementation. This is a measured risk that\ncan be weighed against the benefit. In this case there's basically zero risk;\nif integers and slices are broken, *everyone* is broken. Also, they're maintained\nby the same people who maintain `BTreeMap`, so it's easy to keep tabs on them.\n\nOn the other hand, `BTreeMap`'s key type is generic. Trusting its `Ord` implementation\nmeans trusting every `Ord` implementation in the past, present, and future.\nHere the risk is high: someone somewhere is going to make a mistake and mess up\ntheir `Ord` implementation, or even just straight up lie about providing a total\nordering because \"it seems to work\". When that happens, `BTreeMap` needs to be\nprepared.\n\nThe same logic applies to trusting a closure that's passed to you to behave\ncorrectly.\n\nThis problem of unbounded generic trust is the problem that `unsafe` traits\nexist to resolve. The `BTreeMap` type could theoretically require that keys\nimplement a new trait called `UnsafeOrd`, rather than `Ord`, that might look\nlike this:\n\n```rust\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\n\nunsafe trait UnsafeOrd {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;\n}\n```\n\nThen, a type would use `unsafe` to implement `UnsafeOrd`, indicating that\nthey've ensured their implementation maintains whatever contracts the\ntrait expects. In this situation, the Unsafe Rust in the internals of\n`BTreeMap` would be justified in trusting that the key type's `UnsafeOrd`\nimplementation is correct. If it isn't, it's the fault of the unsafe trait\nimplementation, which is consistent with Rust's safety guarantees.\n\nThe decision of whether to mark a trait `unsafe` is an API design choice. A\nsafe trait is easier to implement, but any unsafe code that relies on it must\ndefend against incorrect behavior. Marking a trait `unsafe` shifts this\nresponsibility to the implementor. Rust has traditionally avoided marking\ntraits `unsafe` because it makes Unsafe Rust pervasive, which isn't desirable.\n\n`Send` and `Sync` are marked unsafe because thread safety is a *fundamental\nproperty* that unsafe code can't possibly hope to defend against in the way it\ncould defend against a buggy `Ord` implementation. Similarly, `GlobalAllocator`\nis keeping accounts of all the memory in the program and other things like\n`Box` or `Vec` build on top of it. If it does something weird (giving the same\nchunk of memory to another request when it is still in use), there's no chance\nto detect that and do anything about it.\n\nThe decision of whether to mark your own traits `unsafe` depends on the same\nsort of consideration. If `unsafe` code can't reasonably expect to defend\nagainst a broken implementation of the trait, then marking the trait `unsafe` is\na reasonable choice.\n\nAs an aside, while `Send` and `Sync` are `unsafe` traits, they are *also*\nautomatically implemented for types when such derivations are provably safe\nto do. `Send` is automatically derived for all types composed only of values\nwhose types also implement `Send`. `Sync` is automatically derived for all\ntypes composed only of values whose types also implement `Sync`. This minimizes\nthe pervasive unsafety of making these two traits `unsafe`. And not many people\nare going to *implement* memory allocators (or use them directly, for that\nmatter).\n\nThis is the balance between Safe and Unsafe Rust. The separation is designed to\nmake using Safe Rust as ergonomic as possible, but requires extra effort and\ncare when writing Unsafe Rust. The rest of this book is largely a discussion\nof the sort of care that must be taken, and what contracts Unsafe Rust must uphold.\n\n[`Send`]: ../std/marker/trait.Send.html\n[`Sync`]: ../std/marker/trait.Sync.html\n[`GlobalAlloc`]: ../std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html\n[conversions]: conversions.html\n[ptr_offset]: ../std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset\n[get_unchecked]: ../std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_unchecked\n[transmute]: ../std/mem/fn.transmute.html\n[`PartialOrd`]: ../std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html\n[`Ord`]: ../std/cmp/trait.Ord.html\n[`BTreeMap`]: ../std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::safe-unsafe-meaning","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"safe-unsafe-meaning","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","soundness","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"How Safe and Unsafe Interact","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"9491190609c262ace15ed578e15ee8979fddfa78dcd276e5dadd2e677571deb2","sig":"5cZaWUoBN6o4DHzNIiHjwVmGJMwK0oAhw59tR6iEot30GradkRncJhCOhmnh+AXvNb/4SAtWghwsdujwkBIaDQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nNot everything obeys inherited mutability, though. Some types allow you to\nhave multiple aliases of a location in memory while mutating it. Unless these types use\nsynchronization to manage this access, they are absolutely not thread-safe. Rust\ncaptures this through the `Send` and `Sync` traits.\n\n* A type is Send if it is safe to send it to another thread.\n* A type is Sync if it is safe to share between threads (T is Sync if and only if `&T` is Send).\n\nSend and Sync are fundamental to Rust's concurrency story. As such, a\nsubstantial amount of special tooling exists to make them work right. First and\nforemost, they're [unsafe traits]. This means that they are unsafe to\nimplement, and other unsafe code can assume that they are correctly\nimplemented. Since they're *marker traits* (they have no associated items like\nmethods), correctly implemented simply means that they have the intrinsic\nproperties an implementor should have. Incorrectly implementing Send or Sync can\ncause Undefined Behavior.\n\nSend and Sync are also automatically derived traits. This means that, unlike\nevery other trait, if a type is composed entirely of Send or Sync types, then it\nis Send or Sync. Almost all primitives are Send and Sync, and as a consequence\npretty much all types you'll ever interact with are Send and Sync.\n\nMajor exceptions include:\n\n* raw pointers are neither Send nor Sync (because they have no safety guards).\n* `UnsafeCell` isn't Sync (and therefore `Cell` and `RefCell` aren't).\n* `Rc` isn't Send or Sync (because the refcount is shared and unsynchronized).\n\n`Rc` and `UnsafeCell` are very fundamentally not thread-safe: they enable\nunsynchronized shared mutable state. However raw pointers are, strictly\nspeaking, marked as thread-unsafe as more of a *lint*. Doing anything useful\nwith a raw pointer requires dereferencing it, which is already unsafe. In that\nsense, one could argue that it would be \"fine\" for them to be marked as thread\nsafe.\n\nHowever it's important that they aren't thread-safe to prevent types that\ncontain them from being automatically marked as thread-safe. These types have\nnon-trivial untracked ownership, and it's unlikely that their author was\nnecessarily thinking hard about thread safety. In the case of `Rc`, we have a nice\nexample of a type that contains a `*mut` that is definitely not thread-safe.\n\nTypes that aren't automatically derived can simply implement them if desired:\n\n```rust\nstruct MyBox(*mut u8);\n\nunsafe impl Send for MyBox {}\nunsafe impl Sync for MyBox {}\n```\n\nIn the *incredibly rare* case that a type is inappropriately automatically\nderived to be Send or Sync, then one can also unimplement Send and Sync:\n\n```rust\n#![feature(negative_impls)]\n\n// I have some magic semantics for some synchronization primitive!\nstruct SpecialThreadToken(u8);\n\nimpl !Send for SpecialThreadToken {}\nimpl !Sync for SpecialThreadToken {}\n```\n\nNote that *in and of itself* it is impossible to incorrectly derive Send and\nSync. Only types that are ascribed special meaning by other unsafe code can\npossibly cause trouble by being incorrectly Send or Sync.\n\nMost uses of raw pointers should be encapsulated behind a sufficient abstraction\nthat Send and Sync can be derived. For instance all of Rust's standard\ncollections are Send and Sync (when they contain Send and Sync types) in spite\nof their pervasive use of raw pointers to manage allocations and complex ownership.\nSimilarly, most iterators into these collections are Send and Sync because they\nlargely behave like an `&` or `&mut` into the collection.\n\n## Example\n\n[`Box`][box-doc] is implemented as its own special intrinsic type by the\ncompiler for [various reasons][box-is-special], but we can implement something\nwith similar-ish behavior ourselves to see an example of when it is sound to\nimplement Send and Sync. Let's call it a `Carton`.\n\nWe start by writing code to take a value allocated on the stack and transfer it\nto the heap.\n\n```rust\n# pub mod libc {\n#    pub use ::std::os::raw::{c_int, c_void};\n#    #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]\n#    pub type size_t = usize;\n#    unsafe extern \"C\" { pub fn posix_memalign(memptr: *mut *mut c_void, align: size_t, size: size_t) -> c_int; }\n# }\nuse std::{\n    mem::{align_of, size_of},\n    ptr,\n    cmp::max,\n};\n\nstruct Carton<T>(ptr::NonNull<T>);\n\nimpl<T> Carton<T> {\n    pub fn new(value: T) -> Self {\n        // Allocate enough memory on the heap to store one T.\n        assert_ne!(size_of::<T>(), 0, \"Zero-sized types are out of the scope of this example\");\n        let mut memptr: *mut T = ptr::null_mut();\n        unsafe {\n            let ret = libc::posix_memalign(\n                (&mut memptr as *mut *mut T).cast(),\n                max(align_of::<T>(), size_of::<usize>()),\n                size_of::<T>()\n            );\n            assert_eq!(ret, 0, \"Failed to allocate or invalid alignment\");\n        };\n\n        // NonNull is just a wrapper that enforces that the pointer isn't null.\n        let ptr = {\n            // Safety: memptr is dereferenceable because we created it from a\n            // reference and have exclusive access.\n            ptr::NonNull::new(memptr)\n                .expect(\"Guaranteed non-null if posix_memalign returns 0\")\n        };\n\n        // Move value from the stack to the location we allocated on the heap.\n        unsafe {\n            // Safety: If non-null, posix_memalign gives us a ptr that is valid\n            // for writes and properly aligned.\n            ptr.as_ptr().write(value);\n        }\n\n        Self(ptr)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis isn't very useful, because once our users give us a value they have no way\nto access it. [`Box`][box-doc] implements [`Deref`][deref-doc] and\n[`DerefMut`][deref-mut-doc] so that you can access the inner value. Let's do\nthat.\n\n```rust\nuse std::ops::{Deref, DerefMut};\n\n# struct Carton<T>(std::ptr::NonNull<T>);\n#\nimpl<T> Deref for Carton<T> {\n    type Target = T;\n\n    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {\n        unsafe {\n            // Safety: The pointer is aligned, initialized, and dereferenceable\n            //   by the logic in [`Self::new`]. We require readers to borrow the\n            //   Carton, and the lifetime of the return value is elided to the\n            //   lifetime of the input. This means the borrow checker will\n            //   enforce that no one can mutate the contents of the Carton until\n            //   the reference returned is dropped.\n            self.0.as_ref()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T> DerefMut for Carton<T> {\n    fn deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Self::Target {\n        unsafe {\n            // Safety: The pointer is aligned, initialized, and dereferenceable\n            //   by the logic in [`Self::new`]. We require writers to mutably\n            //   borrow the Carton, and the lifetime of the return value is\n            //   elided to the lifetime of the input. This means the borrow\n            //   checker will enforce that no one else can access the contents\n            //   of the Carton until the mutable reference returned is dropped.\n            self.0.as_mut()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, let's think about whether our `Carton` is Send and Sync. Something can\nsafely be Send unless it shares mutable state with something else without\nenforcing exclusive access to it. Each `Carton` has a unique pointer, so\nwe're good.\n\n```rust\n# struct Carton<T>(std::ptr::NonNull<T>);\n// Safety: No one besides us has the raw pointer, so we can safely transfer the\n// Carton to another thread if T can be safely transferred.\nunsafe impl<T> Send for Carton<T> where T: Send {}\n```\n\nWhat about Sync? For `Carton` to be Sync we have to enforce that you can't\nwrite to something stored in a `&Carton` while that same something could be read\nor written to from another `&Carton`. Since you need an `&mut Carton` to\nwrite to the pointer, and the borrow checker enforces that mutable\nreferences must be exclusive, there are no soundness issues making `Carton`\nsync either.\n\n```rust\n# struct Carton<T>(std::ptr::NonNull<T>);\n// Safety: Since there exists a public way to go from a `&Carton<T>` to a `&T`\n// in an unsynchronized fashion (such as `Deref`), then `Carton<T>` can't be\n// `Sync` if `T` isn't.\n// Conversely, `Carton` itself does not use any interior mutability whatsoever:\n// all the mutations are performed through an exclusive reference (`&mut`). This\n// means it suffices that `T` be `Sync` for `Carton<T>` to be `Sync`:\nunsafe impl<T> Sync for Carton<T> where T: Sync  {}\n```\n\nWhen we assert our type is Send and Sync we usually need to enforce that every\ncontained type is Send and Sync. When writing custom types that behave like\nstandard library types we can assert that we have the same requirements.\nFor example, the following code asserts that a Carton is Send if the same\nsort of Box would be Send, which in this case is the same as saying T is Send.\n\n```rust\n# struct Carton<T>(std::ptr::NonNull<T>);\nunsafe impl<T> Send for Carton<T> where Box<T>: Send {}\n```\n\nRight now `Carton<T>` has a memory leak, as it never frees the memory it allocates.\nOnce we fix that we have a new requirement we have to ensure we meet to be Send:\nwe need to know `free` can be called on a pointer that was yielded by an\nallocation done on another thread. We can check this is true in the docs for\n[`libc::free`][libc-free-docs].\n\n```rust\n# struct Carton<T>(std::ptr::NonNull<T>);\n# mod libc {\n#     pub use ::std::os::raw::c_void;\n#     unsafe extern \"C\" { pub fn free(p: *mut c_void); }\n# }\nimpl<T> Drop for Carton<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        unsafe {\n            libc::free(self.0.as_ptr().cast());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA nice example where this does not happen is with a MutexGuard: notice how\n[it is not Send][mutex-guard-not-send-docs-rs]. The implementation of MutexGuard\n[uses libraries][mutex-guard-not-send-comment] that require you to ensure you\ndon't try to free a lock that you acquired in a different thread. If you were\nable to Send a MutexGuard to another thread the destructor would run in the\nthread you sent it to, violating the requirement. MutexGuard can still be Sync\nbecause all you can send to another thread is an `&MutexGuard` and dropping a\nreference does nothing.\n\nTODO: better explain what can or can't be Send or Sync.

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nRust uses lifetimes to track the relationships between borrows and ownership.\nHowever, a naive implementation of lifetimes would be either too restrictive,\nor permit undefined behavior.\n\nIn order to allow flexible usage of lifetimes\nwhile also preventing their misuse, Rust uses **subtyping** and **variance**.\n\nLet's start with an example.\n\n```rust\n// Note: debug expects two parameters with the *same* lifetime\nfn debug<'a>(a: &'a str, b: &'a str) {\n    println!(\"a = {a:?} b = {b:?}\");\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let hello: &'static str = \"hello\";\n    {\n        let world = String::from(\"world\");\n        let world = &world; // 'world has a shorter lifetime than 'static\n        debug(hello, world);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn a conservative implementation of lifetimes, since `hello` and `world` have different lifetimes,\nwe might see the following error:\n\n```text\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\n --> src/main.rs:10:16\n   |\n10 |         debug(hello, world);\n   |                      ^\n   |                      |\n   |                      expected `&'static str`, found struct `&'world str`\n```\n\nThis would be rather unfortunate. In this case,\nwhat we want is to accept any type that lives *at least as long* as `'world`.\nLet's try using subtyping with our lifetimes.\n\n## Subtyping\n\nSubtyping is the idea that one type can be used in place of another.\n\nLet's define that `Sub` is a subtype of `Super` (we'll be using the notation `Sub <: Super` throughout this chapter).\n\nWhat this is suggesting to us is that the set of *requirements* that `Super` defines\nare completely satisfied by `Sub`. `Sub` may then have more requirements.\n\nNow, in order to use subtyping with lifetimes, we need to define the requirement of a lifetime:\n\n> `'a` defines a region of code.\n\nNow that we have a defined set of requirements for lifetimes, we can define how they relate to each other:\n\n> `'long <: 'short` if and only if `'long` defines a region of code that **completely contains** `'short`.\n\n`'long` may define a region larger than `'short`, but that still fits our definition.\n\n> As we will see throughout the rest of this chapter,\nsubtyping is a lot more complicated and subtle than this,\nbut this simple rule is a very good 99% intuition.\nAnd unless you write unsafe code, the compiler will automatically handle all the corner cases for you.\n\n> But this is the Rustonomicon. We're writing unsafe code,\nso we need to understand how this stuff really works, and how we can mess it up.\n\nGoing back to our example above, we can say that `'static <: 'world`.\nFor now, let's also accept the idea that subtypes of lifetimes can be passed through references\n(more on this in [Variance](#variance)),\n_e.g._ `&'static str` is a subtype of `&'world str`, then we can \"downgrade\" `&'static str` into a `&'world str`.\nWith that, the example above will compile:\n\n```rust\nfn debug<'a>(a: &'a str, b: &'a str) {\n    println!(\"a = {a:?} b = {b:?}\");\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let hello: &'static str = \"hello\";\n    {\n        let world = String::from(\"world\");\n        let world = &world; // 'world has a shorter lifetime than 'static\n        debug(hello, world); // hello silently downgrades from `&'static str` into `&'world str`\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Variance\n\nAbove, we glossed over the fact that `'static <: 'b` implied that `&'static T <: &'b T`. This uses a property known as _variance_.\nIt's not always as simple as this example, though. To understand that, let's try to extend this example a bit:\n\n```rust,compile_fail,E0597\nfn assign<T>(input: &mut T, val: T) {\n    *input = val;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut hello: &'static str = \"hello\";\n    {\n        let world = String::from(\"world\");\n        assign(&mut hello, &world);\n    }\n    println!(\"{hello}\"); // use after free 😿\n}\n```\n\nIn `assign`, we are setting the `hello` reference to point to `world`.\nBut then `world` goes out of scope, before the later use of `hello` in the println!\n\nThis is a classic use-after-free bug!\n\nOur first instinct might be to blame the `assign` impl, but there's really nothing wrong here.\nIt shouldn't be surprising that we might want to assign a `T` into a `T`.\n\nThe problem is that we cannot assume that `&mut &'static str` and `&mut &'b str` are compatible.\nThis means that `&mut &'static str` **cannot** be a *subtype* of `&mut &'b str`,\neven if `'static` is a subtype of `'b`.\n\nVariance is the concept that Rust borrows to define relationships about subtypes through their generic parameters.\n\n> NOTE: For convenience we will define a generic type `F<T>` so\n> that we can easily talk about `T`. Hopefully this is clear in context.\n\nThe type `F`'s *variance* is how the subtyping of its inputs affects the\nsubtyping of its outputs. There are three kinds of variance in Rust. Given two\ntypes `Sub` and `Super`, where `Sub` is a subtype of `Super`:\n\n* `F` is **covariant** if `F<Sub>` is a subtype of `F<Super>` (the subtype property is passed through)\n* `F` is **contravariant** if `F<Super>` is a subtype of `F<Sub>` (the subtype property is \"inverted\")\n* `F` is **invariant** otherwise (no subtyping relationship exists)\n\nIf we remember from the above examples,\nit was ok for us to treat `&'a T` as a subtype of `&'b T` if `'a <: 'b`,\ntherefore we can say that `&'a T` is *covariant* over `'a`.\n\nAlso, we saw that it was not ok for us to treat `&mut &'a U` as a subtype of `&mut &'b U`,\ntherefore we can say that `&mut T` is *invariant* over `T`\n\nHere is a table of some other generic types and their variances:\n\n|                 |     'a    |         T         |     U     |\n|-----------------|:---------:|:-----------------:|:---------:|\n| `&'a T `        | covariant | covariant         |           |\n| `&'a mut T`     | covariant | invariant         |           |\n| `Box<T>`        |           | covariant         |           |\n| `Vec<T>`        |           | covariant         |           |\n| `UnsafeCell<T>` |           | invariant         |           |\n| `Cell<T>`       |           | invariant         |           |\n| `fn(T) -> U`    |           | **contra**variant | covariant |\n| `*const T`      |           | covariant         |           |\n| `*mut T`        |           | invariant         |           |\n\nSome of these can be explained simply in relation to the others:\n\n* `Vec<T>` and all other owning pointers and collections follow the same logic as `Box<T>`\n* `Cell<T>` and all other interior mutability types follow the same logic as `UnsafeCell<T>`\n* `UnsafeCell<T>` having interior mutability gives it the same variance properties as `&mut T`\n* `*const T` follows the logic of `&T`\n* `*mut T` follows the logic of `&mut T` (or `UnsafeCell<T>`)\n\nFor more types, see the [\"Variance\" section][variance-table] on the reference.\n\n[variance-table]: ../reference/subtyping.html#variance\n\n> NOTE: the *only* source of contravariance in the language is the arguments to\n> a function, which is why it really doesn't come up much in practice. Invoking\n> contravariance involves higher-order programming with function pointers that\n> take references with specific lifetimes (as opposed to the usual \"any lifetime\",\n> which gets into higher rank lifetimes, which work independently of subtyping).\n\nNow that we have some more formal understanding of variance,\nlet's go through some more examples in more detail.\n\n```rust,compile_fail,E0597\nfn assign<T>(input: &mut T, val: T) {\n    *input = val;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut hello: &'static str = \"hello\";\n    {\n        let world = String::from(\"world\");\n        assign(&mut hello, &world);\n    }\n    println!(\"{hello}\");\n}\n```\n\nAnd what do we get when we run this?\n\n```text\nerror[E0597]: `world` does not live long enough\n  --> src/main.rs:9:28\n   |\n6  |     let mut hello: &'static str = \"hello\";\n   |                    ------------ type annotation requires that `world` is borrowed for `'static`\n...\n9  |         assign(&mut hello, &world);\n   |                            ^^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough\n10 |     }\n   |     - `world` dropped here while still borrowed\n```\n\nGood, it doesn't compile! Let's break down what's happening here in detail.\n\nFirst let's look at the `assign` function:\n\n```rust\nfn assign<T>(input: &mut T, val: T) {\n    *input = val;\n}\n```\n\nAll it does is take a mutable reference and a value and overwrite the referent with it.\nWhat's important about this function is that it creates a type equality constraint. It\nclearly says in its signature the referent and the value must be the *exact same* type.\n\nMeanwhile, in the caller we pass in `&mut &'static str` and `&'world str`.\n\nBecause `&mut T` is invariant over `T`, the compiler concludes it can't apply any subtyping\nto the first argument, and so `T` must be exactly `&'static str`.\n\nThis is counter to the `&T` case:\n\n```rust\nfn debug<T: std::fmt::Debug>(a: T, b: T) {\n    println!(\"a = {a:?} b = {b:?}\");\n}\n```\n\nwhere similarly `a` and `b` must have the same type `T`.\nBut since `&'a T` *is* covariant over `'a`, we are allowed to perform subtyping.\nSo the compiler decides that `&'static str` can become `&'b str` if and only if\n`&'static str` is a subtype of `&'b str`, which will hold if `'static <: 'b`.\nThis is true, so the compiler is happy to continue compiling this code.\n\nAs it turns out, the argument for why it's ok for Box (and Vec, HashMap, etc.) to be covariant is pretty similar to the argument for why it's ok for lifetimes to be covariant: as soon as you try to stuff them in something like a mutable reference, they inherit invariance and you're prevented from doing anything bad.\n\nHowever Box makes it easier to focus on the by-value aspect of references that we partially glossed over.\n\nUnlike a lot of languages which allow values to be freely aliased at all times, Rust has a very strict rule: if you're allowed to mutate or move a value, you are guaranteed to be the only one with access to it.\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n```rust,ignore\nlet hello: Box<&'static str> = Box::new(\"hello\");\n\nlet mut world: Box<&'b str>;\nworld = hello;\n```\n\nThere is no problem at all with the fact that we have forgotten that `hello` was alive for `'static`,\nbecause as soon as we moved `hello` to a variable that only knew it was alive for `'b`,\n**we destroyed the only thing in the universe that remembered it lived for longer**!\n\nOnly one thing left to explain: function pointers.\n\nTo see why `fn(T) -> U` should be covariant over `U`, consider the following signature:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn get_str() -> &'a str;\n```\n\nThis function claims to produce a `str` bound by some lifetime `'a`. As such, it is perfectly valid to\nprovide a function with the following signature instead:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn get_static() -> &'static str;\n```\n\nSo when the function is called, all it's expecting is a `&str` which lives at least the lifetime of `'a`,\nit doesn't matter if the value actually lives longer.\n\nHowever, the same logic does not apply to *arguments*. Consider trying to satisfy:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn store_ref(&'a str);\n```\n\nwith:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn store_static(&'static str);\n```\n\nThe first function can accept any string reference as long as it lives at least for `'a`,\nbut the second cannot accept a string reference that lives for any duration less than `'static`,\nwhich would cause a conflict.\nCovariance doesn't work here. But if we flip it around, it actually *does*\nwork! If we need a function that can handle `&'static str`, a function that can handle *any* reference lifetime\nwill surely work fine.\n\nLet's see this in practice\n\n```rust,compile_fail\n# use std::cell::RefCell;\nthread_local! {\n    pub static StaticVecs: RefCell<Vec<&'static str>> = RefCell::new(Vec::new());\n}\n\n/// saves the input given into a thread local `Vec<&'static str>`\nfn store(input: &'static str) {\n    StaticVecs.with_borrow_mut(|v| v.push(input));\n}\n\n/// Calls the function with it's input (must have the same lifetime!)\nfn demo<'a>(input: &'a str, f: fn(&'a str)) {\n    f(input);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    demo(\"hello\", store); // \"hello\" is 'static. Can call `store` fine\n\n    {\n        let smuggle = String::from(\"smuggle\");\n\n        // `&smuggle` is not static. If we were to call `store` with `&smuggle`,\n        // we would have pushed an invalid lifetime into the `StaticVecs`.\n        // Therefore, `fn(&'static str)` cannot be a subtype of `fn(&'a str)`\n        demo(&smuggle, store);\n    }\n\n    // use after free 😿\n    StaticVecs.with_borrow(|v| println!(\"{v:?}\"));\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's why function types, unlike anything else in the language, are\n**contra**variant over their arguments.\n\nNow, this is all well and good for the types the standard library provides, but\nhow is variance determined for types that *you* define? A struct, informally\nspeaking, inherits the variance of its fields. If a struct `MyType`\nhas a generic argument `A` that is used in a field `a`, then MyType's variance\nover `A` is exactly `a`'s variance over `A`.\n\nHowever if `A` is used in multiple fields:\n\n* If all uses of `A` are covariant, then MyType is covariant over `A`\n* If all uses of `A` are contravariant, then MyType is contravariant over `A`\n* Otherwise, MyType is invariant over `A`\n\n```rust\nuse std::cell::Cell;\n\nstruct MyType<'a, 'b, A: 'a, B: 'b, C, D, E, F, G, H, In, Out, Mixed> {\n    a: &'a A,     // covariant over 'a and A\n    b: &'b mut B, // covariant over 'b and invariant over B\n\n    c: *const C,  // covariant over C\n    d: *mut D,    // invariant over D\n\n    e: E,         // covariant over E\n    f: Vec<F>,    // covariant over F\n    g: Cell<G>,   // invariant over G\n\n    h1: H,        // would also be covariant over H except...\n    h2: Cell<H>,  // invariant over H, because invariance wins all conflicts\n\n    i: fn(In) -> Out,       // contravariant over In, covariant over Out\n\n    k1: fn(Mixed) -> usize, // would be contravariant over Mixed except..\n    k2: Mixed,              // invariant over Mixed, because invariance wins all conflicts\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::subtyping","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"subtyping","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Subtyping and Variance","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"43570ba95fd839fad70582e73db1517161daf5bc8f2756f69b7c98d03bcb9078","sig":"p7EqBEaITh/MMJXHqOLUAoDLDjNUXrJGQ0KFqfnCbNFbIJJoD3D4+JGMaM3bBgFbumfDP09k3xlTg6oCAugFAQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Even though this book is all about doing things that are unsafe, I\nreally can't emphasize enough that you should deeply think about finding Another Way\nthan the operations covered in this section. This is really, truly, the most\nhorribly unsafe thing you can do in Rust. The guardrails here are dental floss.\n\n[`mem::transmute<T, U>`][transmute] takes a value of type `T` and reinterprets\nit to have type `U`. The only restriction is that the `T` and `U` are verified\nto have the same size. The ways to cause Undefined Behavior with this are mind\nboggling.\n\n* First and foremost, creating an instance of *any* type with an invalid state\n  is going to cause arbitrary chaos that can't really be predicted. Do not\n  transmute `3` to `bool`. Even if you never *do* anything with the `bool`. Just\n  don't.\n\n* Transmute has an overloaded return type. If you do not specify the return type\n  it may produce a surprising type to satisfy inference.\n\n* Transmuting an `&` to `&mut` is Undefined Behavior. While certain usages may\n  *appear* safe, note that the Rust optimizer is free to assume that a shared\n  reference won't change through its lifetime and thus such transmutation will\n  run afoul of those assumptions. So:\n  * Transmuting an `&` to `&mut` is *always* Undefined Behavior.\n  * No you can't do it.\n  * No you're not special.\n\n* Transmuting to a reference without an explicitly provided lifetime\n  produces an [unbounded lifetime].\n\n* When transmuting between different compound types, you have to make sure they\n  are laid out the same way! If layouts differ, the wrong fields are going to\n  get filled with the wrong data, which will make you unhappy and can also be\n  Undefined Behavior (see above).\n\n  So how do you know if the layouts are the same? For `repr(C)` types and\n  `repr(transparent)` types, layout is precisely defined. But for your\n  run-of-the-mill `repr(Rust)`, it is not. Even different instances of the same\n  generic type can have wildly different layout. `Vec<i32>` and `Vec<u32>`\n  *might* have their fields in the same order, or they might not. The details of\n  what exactly is and is not guaranteed for data layout are still being worked\n  out over [at the UCG WG][ucg-layout].\n\n[`mem::transmute_copy<T, U>`][transmute_copy] somehow manages to be *even more*\nwildly unsafe than this. It copies `size_of<U>` bytes out of an `&T` and\ninterprets them as a `U`.  The size check that `mem::transmute` has is gone (as\nit may be valid to copy out a prefix), though it is Undefined Behavior for `U`\nto be larger than `T`.\n\nAlso of course you can get all of the functionality of these functions using raw\npointer casts or `union`s, but without any of the lints or other basic sanity\nchecks.

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nUnsafe code can often end up producing references or lifetimes out of thin air.\nSuch lifetimes come into the world as *unbounded*. The most common source of\nthis is taking a reference to a dereferenced raw pointer, which produces a\nreference with an unbounded lifetime. Such a lifetime becomes as big as context\ndemands. This is in fact more powerful than simply becoming `'static`, because\nfor instance `&'static &'a T` will fail to typecheck, but the unbound lifetime\nwill perfectly mold into `&'a &'a T` as needed. However for most intents and\npurposes, such an unbounded lifetime can be regarded as `'static`.\n\nAlmost no reference is `'static`, so this is probably wrong. `transmute` and\n`transmute_copy` are the two other primary offenders. One should endeavor to\nbound an unbounded lifetime as quickly as possible, especially across function\nboundaries.\n\nGiven a function, any output lifetimes that don't derive from inputs are\nunbounded. For instance:\n\n<!-- no_run: This example exhibits undefined behavior. -->\n```rust,no_run\nfn get_str<'a>(s: *const String) -> &'a str {\n    unsafe { &*s }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let soon_dropped = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let dangling = get_str(&soon_dropped);\n    drop(soon_dropped);\n    println!(\"Invalid str: {}\", dangling); // Invalid str: gӚ_`\n}\n```\n\nThe easiest way to avoid unbounded lifetimes is to use lifetime elision at the\nfunction boundary. If an output lifetime is elided, then it *must* be bounded by\nan input lifetime. Of course it might be bounded by the *wrong* lifetime, but\nthis will usually just cause a compiler error, rather than allow memory safety\nto be trivially violated.\n\nWithin a function, bounding lifetimes is more error-prone. The safest and easiest\nway to bound a lifetime is to return it from a function with a bound lifetime.\nHowever if this is unacceptable, the reference can be placed in a location with\na specific lifetime. Unfortunately it's impossible to name all lifetimes involved\nin a function.","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::unbounded-lifetimes","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"unbounded-lifetimes","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Unbounded Lifetimes","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"5120cbe3ec1df2aded59a6fd97854a3652829d626f751b65bd19c0e65cc398d1","sig":"H+lSsjB2ymiKO0Hf7IHQJK+tDKIRAC1b5R6MSXYX0pjyewMwxfhkAwiY0QB25MEEoN6D1koBG8Fb89+CYWmeDw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nOne interesting exception to this rule is working with arrays. Safe Rust doesn't\npermit you to partially initialize an array. When you initialize an array, you\ncan either set every value to the same thing with `let x = [val; N]`, or you can\nspecify each member individually with `let x = [val1, val2, val3]`.\nUnfortunately this is pretty rigid, especially if you need to initialize your\narray in a more incremental or dynamic way.\n\nUnsafe Rust gives us a powerful tool to handle this problem:\n[`MaybeUninit`]. This type can be used to handle memory that has not been fully\ninitialized yet.\n\nWith `MaybeUninit`, we can initialize an array element by element as follows:\n\n```rust\nuse std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};\n\n// Size of the array is hard-coded but easy to change (meaning, changing just\n// the constant is sufficient). This means we can't use [a, b, c] syntax to\n// initialize the array, though, as we would have to keep that in sync\n// with `SIZE`!\nconst SIZE: usize = 10;\n\nlet x = {\n    // Create an uninitialized array of `MaybeUninit`. The `assume_init` is\n    // safe because the type we are claiming to have initialized here is a\n    // bunch of `MaybeUninit`s, which do not require initialization.\n    let mut x: [MaybeUninit<Box<u32>>; SIZE] = unsafe {\n        MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()\n    };\n\n    // Dropping a `MaybeUninit` does nothing. Thus using raw pointer\n    // assignment instead of `ptr::write` does not cause the old\n    // uninitialized value to be dropped.\n    // Exception safety is not a concern because Box can't panic\n    for i in 0..SIZE {\n        x[i] = MaybeUninit::new(Box::new(i as u32));\n    }\n\n    // Everything is initialized. Transmute the array to the\n    // initialized type.\n    unsafe { mem::transmute::<_, [Box<u32>; SIZE]>(x) }\n};\n\ndbg!(x);\n```\n\nThis code proceeds in three steps:\n\n1. Create an array of `MaybeUninit<T>`. With current stable Rust, we have to use\n   unsafe code for this: we take some uninitialized piece of memory\n   (`MaybeUninit::uninit()`) and claim we have fully initialized it\n   ([`assume_init()`][assume_init]). This seems ridiculous, because we didn't!\n   The reason this is correct is that the array consists itself entirely of\n   `MaybeUninit`, which do not actually require initialization. For most other\n   types, doing `MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()` produces an invalid\n   instance of said type, so you got yourself some Undefined Behavior.\n\n2. Initialize the array. The subtle aspect of this is that usually, when we use\n   `=` to assign to a value that the Rust type checker considers to already be\n   initialized (like `x[i]`), the old value stored on the left-hand side gets\n   dropped. This would be a disaster. However, in this case, the type of the\n   left-hand side is `MaybeUninit<Box<u32>>`, and dropping that does not do\n   anything! See below for some more discussion of this `drop` issue.\n\n3. Finally, we have to change the type of our array to remove the\n   `MaybeUninit`. With current stable Rust, this requires a `transmute`.\n   This transmute is legal because in memory, `MaybeUninit<T>` looks the same as `T`.\n\n    However, note that in general, `Container<MaybeUninit<T>>>` does *not* look\n   the same as `Container<T>`! Imagine if `Container` was `Option`, and `T` was\n   `bool`, then `Option<bool>` exploits that `bool` only has two valid values,\n   but `Option<MaybeUninit<bool>>` cannot do that because the `bool` does not\n   have to be initialized.\n\n    So, it depends on `Container` whether transmuting away the `MaybeUninit` is\n   allowed. For arrays, it is (and eventually the standard library will\n   acknowledge that by providing appropriate methods).\n\nIt's worth spending a bit more time on the loop in the middle, and in particular\nthe assignment operator and its interaction with `drop`. If we wrote something like:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\n*x[i].as_mut_ptr() = Box::new(i as u32); // WRONG!\n```\n\nwe would actually overwrite a `Box<u32>`, leading to `drop` of uninitialized\ndata, which would cause much sadness and pain.\n\nThe correct alternative, if for some reason we cannot use `MaybeUninit::new`, is\nto use the [`ptr`] module. In particular, it provides three functions that allow\nus to assign bytes to a location in memory without dropping the old value:\n[`write`], [`copy`], and [`copy_nonoverlapping`].\n\n* `ptr::write(ptr, val)` takes a `val` and moves it into the address pointed\n  to by `ptr`.\n* `ptr::copy(src, dest, count)` copies the bits that `count` T items would occupy\n  from src to dest. (this is equivalent to C's memmove -- note that the argument\n  order is reversed!)\n* `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src, dest, count)` does what `copy` does, but a\n  little faster on the assumption that the two ranges of memory don't overlap.\n  (this is equivalent to C's memcpy -- note that the argument order is reversed!)\n\nIt should go without saying that these functions, if misused, will cause serious\nhavoc or just straight up Undefined Behavior. The only requirement of these\nfunctions *themselves* is that the locations you want to read and write\nare allocated and properly aligned. However, the ways writing arbitrary bits to\narbitrary locations of memory can break things are basically uncountable!\n\nIt's worth noting that you don't need to worry about `ptr::write`-style\nshenanigans with types which don't implement `Drop` or contain `Drop` types,\nbecause Rust knows not to try to drop them. This is what we relied on in the\nabove example.\n\nHowever when working with uninitialized memory you need to be ever-vigilant for\nRust trying to drop values you make like this before they're fully initialized.\nEvery control path through that variable's scope must initialize the value\nbefore it ends, if it has a destructor.\n*[This includes code panicking](unwinding.html)*. `MaybeUninit` helps a bit\nhere, because it does not implicitly drop its content - but all this really\nmeans in case of a panic is that instead of a double-free of the not yet\ninitialized parts, you end up with a memory leak of the already initialized\nparts.\n\nNote that, to use the `ptr` methods, you need to first obtain a *raw pointer* to\nthe data you want to initialize. It is illegal to construct a *reference* to\nuninitialized data, which implies that you have to be careful when obtaining\nsaid raw pointer:\n\n* For an array of `T`, you can use `base_ptr.add(idx)` where `base_ptr: *mut T`\nto compute the address of array index `idx`. This relies on\nhow arrays are laid out in memory.\n* For a struct, however, in general we do not know how it is laid out, and we\nalso cannot use `&mut base_ptr.field` as that would be creating a\nreference. So, you must carefully use the [raw reference][raw_reference] syntax. This creates\na raw pointer to the field without creating an intermediate reference:\n\n```rust\nuse std::{ptr, mem::MaybeUninit};\n\nstruct Demo {\n    field: bool,\n}\n\nlet mut uninit = MaybeUninit::<Demo>::uninit();\n// `&uninit.as_mut().field` would create a reference to an uninitialized `bool`,\n// and thus be Undefined Behavior!\nlet f1_ptr = unsafe { &raw mut (*uninit.as_mut_ptr()).field };\nunsafe { f1_ptr.write(true); }\n\nlet init = unsafe { uninit.assume_init() };\n```\n\nOne last remark: when reading old Rust code, you might stumble upon the\ndeprecated `mem::uninitialized` function.  That function used to be the only way\nto deal with uninitialized memory on the stack, but it turned out to be\nimpossible to properly integrate with the rest of the language.  Always use\n`MaybeUninit` instead in new code, and port old code over when you get the\nopportunity.\n\nAnd that's about it for working with uninitialized memory! Basically nothing\nanywhere expects to be handed uninitialized memory, so if you're going to pass\nit around at all, be sure to be *really* careful.\n\n[`MaybeUninit`]: ../core/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html\n[assume_init]: ../core/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html#method.assume_init\n[`ptr`]: ../core/ptr/index.html\n[raw_reference]: ../reference/types/pointer.html#r-type.pointer.raw.constructor\n[`write`]: ../core/ptr/fn.write.html\n[`copy`]: ../std/ptr/fn.copy.html\n[`copy_nonoverlapping`]: ../std/ptr/fn.copy_nonoverlapping.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::unchecked-uninit","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"unchecked-uninit","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","panic","raw_pointer","undefined_behavior","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Unchecked Uninitialized Memory","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"2a87e101ad5557a79d740a0c8264dccebf8f636888c856097a900ab32fe97032","sig":"8cEuqkyKarBqhcZ99oDz9KE4vv6Xl7Gbln/UiNlmHxy9WGcIEzmReyD79rZ1VFpIHpDDo3Iv/UnXe/I6o9DJAw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Panics could only be caught by the owner of the task, at which\npoint they had to be handled or *that* task would itself panic.\n\nUnwinding was important to this story because if a task's\ndestructors weren't called, it would cause memory and other system resources to\nleak. Since tasks were expected to die during normal execution, this would make\nRust very poor for long-running systems!\n\nAs the Rust we know today came to be, this style of programming grew out of\nfashion in the push for less-and-less abstraction. Light-weight tasks were\nkilled in the name of heavy-weight OS threads. Still, on stable Rust as of 1.0\npanics can only be caught by the parent thread. This means catching a panic\nrequires spinning up an entire OS thread! This unfortunately stands in conflict\nto Rust's philosophy of zero-cost abstractions.\n\nThere is an API called [`catch_unwind`] that enables catching a panic\nwithout spawning a thread. Still, we would encourage you to only do this\nsparingly. In particular, Rust's current unwinding implementation is heavily\noptimized for the \"doesn't unwind\" case. If a program doesn't unwind, there\nshould be no runtime cost for the program being *ready* to unwind. As a\nconsequence, actually unwinding will be more expensive than in e.g. Java.\nDon't build your programs to unwind under normal circumstances. Ideally, you\nshould only panic for programming errors or *extreme* problems.\n\nRust's unwinding strategy is not specified to be fundamentally compatible\nwith any other language's unwinding. As such, unwinding into Rust from another\nlanguage, or unwinding into another language from Rust is Undefined Behavior.\nYou must *absolutely* catch any panics at the FFI boundary! What you do at that\npoint is up to you, but *something* must be done. If you fail to do this,\nat best, your application will crash and burn. At worst, your application *won't*\ncrash and burn, and will proceed with completely clobbered state.\n\n[`catch_unwind`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::unwinding","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"unwinding","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","ffi","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","panic","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Unwinding","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"61465106033c28e3d81e6ebceb5e0880f0cfa045781458e0ce5c870f9d8e7d8f","sig":"uxOdW1/FwxNxKPpR1GH7xZOr8PriDwppQeug5orOlzHAljiAfrRXn6r64vpvlMJT4U/yiNBJI34bwugcwXwBAA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nThe only things that are different in Unsafe Rust are that you can:\n\n* Dereference raw pointers\n* Call `unsafe` functions (including C functions, compiler intrinsics, and the raw allocator)\n* Implement `unsafe` traits\n* Access or modify mutable statics\n* Access fields of `union`s\n\nThat's it. The reason these operations are relegated to Unsafe is that misusing\nany of these things will cause the ever dreaded Undefined Behavior. Invoking\nUndefined Behavior gives the compiler full rights to do arbitrarily bad things\nto your program. You definitely *should not* invoke Undefined Behavior.\n\nUnlike C, Undefined Behavior is pretty limited in scope in Rust. All the core\nlanguage cares about is preventing the following things:\n\n* Dereferencing (using the `*` operator on) dangling or unaligned pointers (see below)\n* Breaking the [pointer aliasing rules][]\n* Calling a function with the wrong call ABI or unwinding from a function with the wrong unwind ABI.\n* Causing a [data race][race]\n* Executing code compiled with [target features][] that the current thread of execution does\n  not support\n* Producing invalid values (either alone or as a field of a compound type such\n  as `enum`/`struct`/array/tuple):\n  * a `bool` that isn't 0 or 1\n  * an `enum` with an invalid discriminant\n  * a null `fn` pointer\n  * a `char` outside the ranges [0x0, 0xD7FF] and [0xE000, 0x10FFFF]\n  * a `!` (all values are invalid for this type)\n  * an integer (`i*`/`u*`), floating point value (`f*`), or raw pointer read from\n    [uninitialized memory][], or uninitialized memory in a `str`.\n  * a reference/`Box` that is dangling, unaligned, or points to an invalid value.\n  * a wide reference, `Box`, or raw pointer that has invalid metadata:\n    * `dyn Trait` metadata is invalid if it is not a pointer to a vtable for\n      `Trait` that matches the actual dynamic trait the pointer or reference points to\n    * slice metadata is invalid if the length is not a valid `usize`\n      (i.e., it must not be read from uninitialized memory)\n  * a type with custom invalid values that is one of those values, such as a\n    [`NonNull`] that is null. (Requesting custom invalid values is an unstable\n    feature, but some stable libstd types, like `NonNull`, make use of it.)\n\nFor a more detailed explanation about \"Undefined Behavior\", you may refer to\n[the reference][behavior-considered-undefined].\n\n\"Producing\" a value happens any time a value is assigned, passed to a\nfunction/primitive operation or returned from a function/primitive operation.\n\nA reference/pointer is \"dangling\" if it is null or not all of the bytes it\npoints to are part of the same allocation (so in particular they all have to be\npart of *some* allocation). The span of bytes it points to is determined by the\npointer value and the size of the pointee type. As a consequence, if the span is\nempty, \"dangling\" is the same as \"null\". Note that slices and strings point\nto their entire range, so it's important that the length metadata is never too\nlarge (in particular, allocations and therefore slices and strings cannot be\nbigger than `isize::MAX` bytes). If for some reason this is too cumbersome,\nconsider using raw pointers.\n\nThat's it. That's all the causes of Undefined Behavior baked into Rust. Of\ncourse, unsafe functions and traits are free to declare arbitrary other\nconstraints that a program must maintain to avoid Undefined Behavior. For\ninstance, the allocator APIs declare that deallocating unallocated memory is\nUndefined Behavior.\n\nHowever, violations of these constraints generally will just transitively lead to one of\nthe above problems. Some additional constraints may also derive from compiler\nintrinsics that make special assumptions about how code can be optimized. For instance,\nVec and Box make use of intrinsics that require their pointers to be non-null at all times.\n\nRust is otherwise quite permissive with respect to other dubious operations.\nRust considers it \"safe\" to:\n\n* Deadlock\n* Have a [race condition][race]\n* Leak memory\n* Overflow integers (with the built-in operators such as `+` etc.)\n* Abort the program\n* Delete the production database\n\nFor more detailed information, you may refer to [the reference][behavior-not-considered-unsafe].\n\nHowever any program that actually manages to do such a thing is *probably*\nincorrect. Rust provides lots of tools to make these things rare, but\nthese problems are considered impractical to categorically prevent.\n\n[pointer aliasing rules]: references.html\n[uninitialized memory]: uninitialized.html\n[race]: races.html\n[target features]: ../reference/attributes/codegen.html#the-target_feature-attribute\n[`NonNull`]: ../std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html\n[behavior-considered-undefined]: ../reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\n[behavior-not-considered-unsafe]: ../reference/behavior-not-considered-unsafe.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::what-unsafe-does","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"what-unsafe-does","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["aliasing","arc_pitfalls","concurrency","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","undefined_behavior","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"What Unsafe Rust Can Do","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"017affb3d1c64affad7748aa67fe8ec159cc4a359f239f1e3abec5bcca890aa0","sig":"qq7m+47kU7lDIeTlE5KSQPQaiaDh3p1VFfOJpvTjP8vlS50g+iLfz/l7bpUYh0pOfoLcd0aAZcLBM3nlzr0iCA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nRust generally only gives us the tools to talk about Unsafe Rust in a scoped and\nbinary manner. Unfortunately, reality is significantly more complicated than\nthat. For instance, consider the following toy function:\n\n```rust\nfn index(idx: usize, arr: &[u8]) -> Option<u8> {\n    if idx < arr.len() {\n        unsafe {\n            Some(*arr.get_unchecked(idx))\n        }\n    } else {\n        None\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function is safe and correct. We check that the index is in bounds, and if\nit is, index into the array in an unchecked manner. We say that such a correct\nunsafely implemented function is *sound*, meaning that safe code cannot cause\nUndefined Behavior through it (which, remember, is the single fundamental\nproperty of Safe Rust).\n\nBut even in such a trivial function, the scope of the unsafe block is\nquestionable. Consider changing the `<` to a `<=`:\n\n```rust\nfn index(idx: usize, arr: &[u8]) -> Option<u8> {\n    if idx <= arr.len() {\n        unsafe {\n            Some(*arr.get_unchecked(idx))\n        }\n    } else {\n        None\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program is now *unsound*, Safe Rust can cause Undefined Behavior, and yet\n*we only modified safe code*. This is the fundamental problem of safety: it's\nnon-local. The soundness of our unsafe operations necessarily depends on the\nstate established by otherwise \"safe\" operations.\n\nSafety is modular in the sense that opting into unsafety doesn't require you\nto consider arbitrary other kinds of badness. For instance, doing an unchecked\nindex into a slice doesn't mean you suddenly need to worry about the slice being\nnull or containing uninitialized memory. Nothing fundamentally changes. However\nsafety *isn't* modular in the sense that programs are inherently stateful and\nyour unsafe operations may depend on arbitrary other state.\n\nThis non-locality gets much worse when we incorporate actual persistent state.\nConsider a simple implementation of `Vec`:\n\n```rust\nuse std::ptr;\n\n// Note: This definition is naive. See the chapter on implementing Vec.\npub struct Vec<T> {\n    ptr: *mut T,\n    len: usize,\n    cap: usize,\n}\n\n// Note this implementation does not correctly handle zero-sized types.\n// See the chapter on implementing Vec.\nimpl<T> Vec<T> {\n    pub fn push(&mut self, elem: T) {\n        if self.len == self.cap {\n            // not important for this example\n            self.reallocate();\n        }\n        unsafe {\n            ptr::write(self.ptr.add(self.len), elem);\n            self.len += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    # fn reallocate(&mut self) { }\n}\n\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nThis code is simple enough to reasonably audit and informally verify. Now consider\nadding the following method:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn make_room(&mut self) {\n    // grow the capacity\n    self.cap += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThis code is 100% Safe Rust but it is also completely unsound. Changing the\ncapacity violates the invariants of Vec (that `cap` reflects the allocated space\nin the Vec). This is not something the rest of Vec can guard against. It *has*\nto trust the capacity field because there's no way to verify it.\n\nBecause it relies on invariants of a struct field, this `unsafe` code\ndoes more than pollute a whole function: it pollutes a whole *module*.\nGenerally, the only bullet-proof way to limit the scope of unsafe code is at the\nmodule boundary with privacy.\n\nHowever this works *perfectly*. The existence of `make_room` is *not* a\nproblem for the soundness of Vec because we didn't mark it as public. Only the\nmodule that defines this function can call it. Also, `make_room` directly\naccesses the private fields of Vec, so it can only be written in the same module\nas Vec.\n\nIt is therefore possible for us to write a completely safe abstraction that\nrelies on complex invariants. This is *critical* to the relationship between\nSafe Rust and Unsafe Rust.\n\nWe have already seen that Unsafe code must trust *some* Safe code, but shouldn't\ntrust *generic* Safe code. Privacy is important to unsafe code for similar reasons:\nit prevents us from having to trust all the safe code in the universe from messing\nwith our trusted state.\n\nSafety lives!","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::working-with-unsafe","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"working-with-unsafe","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","soundness","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Working with Unsafe","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"0d725c9560cde96b189dcad7eed5f104c7627ed22cac4f50a0115861e1f55e21","sig":"NLClxEt4+F6k8wbqKEIz78+8i0CqayNGQ8qvpnnI4VQ5cETnTfa6TJtRnLlpKz/Zjp+chcsluX276ZzlLWFaDg==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nNow that we've decided the layout for our implementation of `Arc`, let's create\nsome basic code.\n\n## Constructing the Arc\n\nWe'll first need a way to construct an `Arc<T>`.\n\nThis is pretty simple, as we just need to box the `ArcInner<T>` and get a\n`NonNull<T>` pointer to it.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Arc<T> {\n    pub fn new(data: T) -> Arc<T> {\n        // We start the reference count at 1, as that first reference is the\n        // current pointer.\n        let boxed = Box::new(ArcInner {\n            rc: AtomicUsize::new(1),\n            data,\n        });\n        Arc {\n            // It is okay to call `.unwrap()` here as we get a pointer from\n            // `Box::into_raw` which is guaranteed to not be null.\n            ptr: NonNull::new(Box::into_raw(boxed)).unwrap(),\n            phantom: PhantomData,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Send and Sync\n\nSince we're building a concurrency primitive, we'll need to be able to send it\nacross threads. Thus, we can implement the `Send` and `Sync` marker traits. For\nmore information on these, see [the section on `Send` and\n`Sync`](../send-and-sync.md).\n\nThis is okay because:\n* You can only get a mutable reference to the value inside an `Arc` if and only\n  if it is the only `Arc` referencing that data (which only happens in `Drop`)\n* We use atomics for the shared mutable reference counting\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nunsafe impl<T: Sync + Send> Send for Arc<T> {}\nunsafe impl<T: Sync + Send> Sync for Arc<T> {}\n```\n\nWe need to have the bound `T: Sync + Send` because if we did not provide those\nbounds, it would be possible to share values that are thread-unsafe across a\nthread boundary via an `Arc`, which could possibly cause data races or\nunsoundness.\n\nFor example, if those bounds were not present, `Arc<Rc<u32>>` would be `Sync` or\n`Send`, meaning that you could clone the `Rc` out of the `Arc` to send it across\na thread (without creating an entirely new `Rc`), which would create data races\nas `Rc` is not thread-safe.\n\n## Getting the `ArcInner`\n\nTo dereference the `NonNull<T>` pointer into a `&T`, we can call\n`NonNull::as_ref`. This is unsafe, unlike the typical `as_ref` function, so we\nmust call it like this:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nunsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() }\n```\n\nWe'll be using this snippet a few times in this code (usually with an associated\n`let` binding).\n\nThis unsafety is okay because while this `Arc` is alive, we're guaranteed that\nthe inner pointer is valid.\n\n## Deref\n\nAlright. Now we can make `Arc`s (and soon will be able to clone and destroy them correctly), but how do we get\nto the data inside?\n\nWhat we need now is an implementation of `Deref`.\n\nWe'll need to import the trait:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::ops::Deref;\n```\n\nAnd here's the implementation:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Deref for Arc<T> {\n    type Target = T;\n\n    fn deref(&self) -> &T {\n        let inner = unsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() };\n        &inner.data\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPretty simple, eh? This simply dereferences the `NonNull` pointer to the\n`ArcInner<T>`, then gets a reference to the data inside.\n\n## Code\n\nHere's all the code from this section:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::ops::Deref;\n\nimpl<T> Arc<T> {\n    pub fn new(data: T) -> Arc<T> {\n        // We start the reference count at 1, as that first reference is the\n        // current pointer.\n        let boxed = Box::new(ArcInner {\n            rc: AtomicUsize::new(1),\n            data,\n        });\n        Arc {\n            // It is okay to call `.unwrap()` here as we get a pointer from\n            // `Box::into_raw` which is guaranteed to not be null.\n            ptr: NonNull::new(Box::into_raw(boxed)).unwrap(),\n            phantom: PhantomData,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nunsafe impl<T: Sync + Send> Send for Arc<T> {}\nunsafe impl<T: Sync + Send> Sync for Arc<T> {}\n\n\nimpl<T> Deref for Arc<T> {\n    type Target = T;\n\n    fn deref(&self) -> &T {\n        let inner = unsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() };\n        &inner.data\n    }\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::arc-base","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"arc-base","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","soundness","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Base Code","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"92da72ff1aee83e4718236bdee69f1a063e1e8051c26724a1ed01255cc8731c7","sig":"lyiHiYP/ZjFoQRs1vRVbCGkb+cQJS9pGFWrux2dlhe3l3kueuFj+vtCl7i3n0uZbk/A468LUEcWPMtY4DuR0BQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Increment the atomic reference count\n2. Construct a new instance of the `Arc` from the inner pointer\n\nFirst, we need to get access to the `ArcInner`:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet inner = unsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() };\n```\n\nWe can update the atomic reference count as follows:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet old_rc = inner.rc.fetch_add(1, Ordering::???);\n```\n\nBut what ordering should we use here? We don't really have any code that will\nneed atomic synchronization when cloning, as we do not modify the internal value\nwhile cloning. Thus, we can use a Relaxed ordering here, which implies no\nhappens-before relationship but is atomic. When `Drop`ping the Arc, however,\nwe'll need to atomically synchronize when decrementing the reference count. This\nis described more in [the section on the `Drop` implementation for\n`Arc`](arc-drop.md). For more information on atomic relationships and Relaxed\nordering, see [the section on atomics](../atomics.md).\n\nThus, the code becomes this:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet old_rc = inner.rc.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);\n```\n\nWe'll need to add another import to use `Ordering`:\n\n```rust\nuse std::sync::atomic::Ordering;\n```\n\nHowever, we have one problem with this implementation right now. What if someone\ndecides to `mem::forget` a bunch of Arcs? The code we have written so far (and\nwill write) assumes that the reference count accurately portrays how many Arcs\nare in memory, but with `mem::forget` this is false. Thus, when more and more\nArcs are cloned from this one without them being `Drop`ped and the reference\ncount being decremented, we can overflow! This will cause use-after-free which\nis **INCREDIBLY BAD!**\n\nTo handle this, we need to check that the reference count does not go over some\narbitrary value (below `usize::MAX`, as we're storing the reference count as an\n`AtomicUsize`), and do *something*.\n\nThe standard library's implementation decides to just abort the program (as it\nis an incredibly unlikely case in normal code and if it happens, the program is\nprobably incredibly degenerate) if the reference count reaches `isize::MAX`\n(about half of `usize::MAX`) on any thread, on the assumption that there are\nprobably not about 2 billion threads (or about **9 quintillion** on some 64-bit\nmachines) incrementing the reference count at once. This is what we'll do.\n\nIt's pretty simple to implement this behavior:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nif old_rc >= isize::MAX as usize {\n    std::process::abort();\n}\n```\n\nThen, we need to return a new instance of the `Arc`:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nSelf {\n    ptr: self.ptr,\n    phantom: PhantomData\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's wrap this all up inside the `Clone` implementation:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::sync::atomic::Ordering;\n\nimpl<T> Clone for Arc<T> {\n    fn clone(&self) -> Arc<T> {\n        let inner = unsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() };\n        // Using a relaxed ordering is alright here as we don't need any atomic\n        // synchronization here as we're not modifying or accessing the inner\n        // data.\n        let old_rc = inner.rc.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);\n\n        if old_rc >= isize::MAX as usize {\n            std::process::abort();\n        }\n\n        Self {\n            ptr: self.ptr,\n            phantom: PhantomData,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::arc-clone","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"arc-clone","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Cloning","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"a54c295dfc9412bb1ecda626a62c2a4672a54baea6aa9402662d095fb10a94a8","sig":"RuhSCLIXju5XVBKI22YDF83wpAHIXwlAcw4pwYZZGqEi952Kc6nREFkOjJo5ajpzeh07J3Y+3D9FNvZyfVy4Dw==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Decrement the reference count\n2. If there is only one reference remaining to the data, then:\n3. Atomically fence the data to prevent reordering of the use and deletion of\n   the data\n4. Drop the inner data\n\nFirst, we'll need to get access to the `ArcInner`:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nlet inner = unsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() };\n```\n\nNow, we need to decrement the reference count.

As described in [the standard library's\nimplementation of `Arc`][3]:\n> This fence is needed to prevent reordering of use of the data and deletion of\n> the data.

It is valid but carries high risk and should be avoided in production unless explicitly justified."},"content":"> ⚠️ **Codex Warning**: This entry demonstrates behavior that is valid Rust but not safe or idiomatic. Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nLet's start by making the layout for our implementation of `Arc`.\n\nAn `Arc<T>` provides thread-safe shared ownership of a value of type `T`,\nallocated in the heap. Sharing implies immutability in Rust, so we don't need to\ndesign anything that manages access to that value, right? Although interior\nmutability types like Mutex allow Arc's users to create shared mutability, Arc\nitself doesn't need to concern itself with these issues.\n\nHowever there _is_ one place where Arc needs to concern itself with mutation:\ndestruction. When all the owners of the Arc go away, we need to be able to\n`drop` its contents and free its allocation. So we need a way for an owner to\nknow if it's the _last_ owner, and the simplest way to do that is with a count\nof the owners -- Reference Counting.\n\nUnfortunately, this reference count is inherently shared mutable state, so Arc\n_does_ need to think about synchronization. We _could_ use a Mutex for this, but\nthat's overkill. Instead, we'll use atomics. And since everyone already needs a\npointer to the T's allocation, we might as well put the reference count in that\nsame allocation.\n\nNaively, it would look something like this:\n\n```rust\nuse std::sync::atomic;\n\npub struct Arc<T> {\n    ptr: *mut ArcInner<T>,\n}\n\npub struct ArcInner<T> {\n    rc: atomic::AtomicUsize,\n    data: T,\n}\n```\n\nThis would compile, however it would be incorrect. First of all, the compiler\nwill give us too strict variance. For example, an `Arc<&'static str>` couldn't\nbe used where an `Arc<&'a str>` was expected. More importantly, it will give\nincorrect ownership information to the drop checker, as it will assume we don't\nown any values of type `T`. As this is a structure providing shared ownership of\na value, at some point there will be an instance of this structure that entirely\nowns its data. See [the chapter on ownership and lifetimes](../ownership.md) for\nall the details on variance and drop check.\n\nTo fix the first problem, we can use `NonNull<T>`. Note that `NonNull<T>` is a\nwrapper around a raw pointer that declares that:\n\n* We are covariant over `T`\n* Our pointer is never null\n\nTo fix the second problem, we can include a `PhantomData` marker containing an\n`ArcInner<T>`. This will tell the drop checker that we have some notion of\nownership of a value of `ArcInner<T>` (which itself contains some `T`).\n\nWith these changes we get our final structure:\n\n```rust\nuse std::marker::PhantomData;\nuse std::ptr::NonNull;\nuse std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize;\n\npub struct Arc<T> {\n    ptr: NonNull<ArcInner<T>>,\n    phantom: PhantomData<ArcInner<T>>,\n}\n\npub struct ArcInner<T> {\n    rc: AtomicUsize,\n    data: T,\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::arc-layout","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"arc-layout","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","concurrency","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Layout","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"1501dbbe612e46c47ee156049adc4c0d77518394d88ab39d4080936273c57c9c","sig":"TH6JTZ12zhe2Q2IEEf/Jsb08Ow3dr9zjedaFiKG+s3OpHA4mN5Eqc1c034WC5bcebdFuKhleB7IxaviXdNRECA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nUsing `NonNull` throws a wrench in an important feature of Vec (and indeed all of\nthe std collections): creating an empty Vec doesn't actually allocate at all. This\nis not the same as allocating a zero-sized memory block, which is not allowed by\nthe global allocator (it results in undefined behavior!). So if we can't allocate,\nbut also can't put a null pointer in `ptr`, what do we do in `Vec::new`? Well, we\njust put some other garbage in there!\n\nThis is perfectly fine because we already have `cap == 0` as our sentinel for no\nallocation. We don't even need to handle it specially in almost any code because\nwe usually need to check if `cap > len` or `len > 0` anyway. The recommended\nRust value to put here is `mem::align_of::<T>()`. `NonNull` provides a convenience\nfor this: `NonNull::dangling()`. There are quite a few places where we'll\nwant to use `dangling` because there's no real allocation to talk about but\n`null` would make the compiler do bad things.\n\nSo:\n\n<!-- ignore: explanation code -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::mem;\n\nimpl<T> Vec<T> {\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        assert!(mem::size_of::<T>() != 0, \"We're not ready to handle ZSTs\");\n        Vec {\n            ptr: NonNull::dangling(),\n            len: 0,\n            cap: 0,\n        }\n    }\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nI slipped in that assert there because zero-sized types will require some\nspecial handling throughout our code, and I want to defer the issue for now.\nWithout this assert, some of our early drafts will do some Very Bad Things.\n\nNext we need to figure out what to actually do when we *do* want space. For that,\nwe use the global allocation functions [`alloc`][alloc], [`realloc`][realloc],\nand [`dealloc`][dealloc] which are available in stable Rust in\n[`std::alloc`][std_alloc]. These functions are expected to become deprecated in\nfavor of the methods of [`std::alloc::Global`][Global] after this type is stabilized.\n\nWe'll also need a way to handle out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. The standard\nlibrary provides a function [`alloc::handle_alloc_error`][handle_alloc_error],\nwhich will abort the program in a platform-specific manner.\nThe reason we abort and don't panic is because unwinding can cause allocations\nto happen, and that seems like a bad thing to do when your allocator just came\nback with \"hey I don't have any more memory\".\n\nOf course, this is a bit silly since most platforms don't actually run out of\nmemory in a conventional way. Your operating system will probably kill the\napplication by another means if you legitimately start using up all the memory.\nThe most likely way we'll trigger OOM is by just asking for ludicrous quantities\nof memory at once (e.g. half the theoretical address space). As such it's\n*probably* fine to panic and nothing bad will happen. Still, we're trying to be\nlike the standard library as much as possible, so we'll just kill the whole\nprogram.\n\nOkay, now we can write growing. Roughly, we want to have this logic:\n\n```text\nif cap == 0:\n    allocate()\n    cap = 1\nelse:\n    reallocate()\n    cap *= 2\n```\n\nBut Rust's only supported allocator API is so low level that we'll need to do a\nfair bit of extra work. We also need to guard against some special\nconditions that can occur with really large allocations or empty allocations.\n\nIn particular, `ptr::offset` will cause us a lot of trouble, because it has\nthe semantics of LLVM's GEP inbounds instruction. If you're fortunate enough to\nnot have dealt with this instruction, here's the basic story with GEP: alias\nanalysis, alias analysis, alias analysis. It's super important to an optimizing\ncompiler to be able to reason about data dependencies and aliasing.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the following fragment of code:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\n*x *= 7;\n*y *= 3;\n```\n\nIf the compiler can prove that `x` and `y` point to different locations in\nmemory, the two operations can in theory be executed in parallel (by e.g.\nloading them into different registers and working on them independently).\nHowever the compiler can't do this in general because if x and y point to\nthe same location in memory, the operations need to be done to the same value,\nand they can't just be merged afterwards.\n\nWhen you use GEP inbounds, you are specifically telling LLVM that the offsets\nyou're about to do are within the bounds of a single \"allocated\" entity. The\nultimate payoff being that LLVM can assume that if two pointers are known to\npoint to two disjoint objects, all the offsets of those pointers are *also*\nknown to not alias (because you won't just end up in some random place in\nmemory). LLVM is heavily optimized to work with GEP offsets, and inbounds\noffsets are the best of all, so it's important that we use them as much as\npossible.\n\nSo that's what GEP's about, how can it cause us trouble?\n\nThe first problem is that we index into arrays with unsigned integers, but\nGEP (and as a consequence `ptr::offset`) takes a signed integer. This means\nthat half of the seemingly valid indices into an array will overflow GEP and\nactually go in the wrong direction! As such we must limit all allocations to\n`isize::MAX` elements. This actually means we only need to worry about\nbyte-sized objects, because e.g. `> isize::MAX` `u16`s will truly exhaust all of\nthe system's memory. However in order to avoid subtle corner cases where someone\nreinterprets some array of `< isize::MAX` objects as bytes, std limits all\nallocations to `isize::MAX` bytes.\n\nOn all 64-bit targets that Rust currently supports we're artificially limited\nto significantly less than all 64 bits of the address space (modern x64\nplatforms only expose 48-bit addressing), so we can rely on just running out of\nmemory first. However on 32-bit targets, particularly those with extensions to\nuse more of the address space (PAE x86 or x32), it's theoretically possible to\nsuccessfully allocate more than `isize::MAX` bytes of memory.\n\nHowever since this is a tutorial, we're not going to be particularly optimal\nhere, and just unconditionally check, rather than use clever platform-specific\n`cfg`s.\n\nThe other corner-case we need to worry about is empty allocations. There will\nbe two kinds of empty allocations we need to worry about: `cap = 0` for all T,\nand `cap > 0` for zero-sized types.\n\nThese cases are tricky because they come\ndown to what LLVM means by \"allocated\". LLVM's notion of an\nallocation is significantly more abstract than how we usually use it. Because\nLLVM needs to work with different languages' semantics and custom allocators,\nit can't really intimately understand allocation. Instead, the main idea behind\nallocation is \"doesn't overlap with other stuff\". That is, heap allocations,\nstack allocations, and globals don't randomly overlap. Yep, it's about alias\nanalysis. As such, Rust can technically play a bit fast and loose with the notion of\nan allocation as long as it's *consistent*.\n\nGetting back to the empty allocation case, there are a couple of places where\nwe want to offset by 0 as a consequence of generic code. The question is then:\nis it consistent to do so? For zero-sized types, we have concluded that it is\nindeed consistent to do a GEP inbounds offset by an arbitrary number of\nelements. This is a runtime no-op because every element takes up no space,\nand it's fine to pretend that there's infinite zero-sized types allocated\nat `0x01`. No allocator will ever allocate that address, because they won't\nallocate `0x00` and they generally allocate to some minimal alignment higher\nthan a byte. Also generally the whole first page of memory is\nprotected from being allocated anyway (a whole 4k, on many platforms).\n\nHowever what about for positive-sized types? That one's a bit trickier. In\nprinciple, you can argue that offsetting by 0 gives LLVM no information: either\nthere's an element before the address or after it, but it can't know which.\nHowever we've chosen to conservatively assume that it may do bad things. As\nsuch we will guard against this case explicitly.\n\n*Phew*\n\nOk with all the nonsense out of the way, let's actually allocate some memory:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::alloc::{self, Layout};\n\nimpl<T> Vec<T> {\n    fn grow(&mut self) {\n        let (new_cap, new_layout) = if self.cap == 0 {\n            (1, Layout::array::<T>(1).unwrap())\n        } else {\n            // This can't overflow since self.cap <= isize::MAX.\n            let new_cap = 2 * self.cap;\n\n            // `Layout::array` checks that the number of bytes is <= usize::MAX,\n            // but this is redundant since old_layout.size() <= isize::MAX,\n            // so the `unwrap` should never fail.\n            let new_layout = Layout::array::<T>(new_cap).unwrap();\n            (new_cap, new_layout)\n        };\n\n        // Ensure that the new allocation doesn't exceed `isize::MAX` bytes.\n        assert!(new_layout.size() <= isize::MAX as usize, \"Allocation too large\");\n\n        let new_ptr = if self.cap == 0 {\n            unsafe { alloc::alloc(new_layout) }\n        } else {\n            let old_layout = Layout::array::<T>(self.cap).unwrap();\n            let old_ptr = self.ptr.as_ptr() as *mut u8;\n            unsafe { alloc::realloc(old_ptr, old_layout, new_layout.size()) }\n        };\n\n        // If allocation fails, `new_ptr` will be null, in which case we abort.\n        self.ptr = match NonNull::new(new_ptr as *mut T) {\n            Some(p) => p,\n            None => alloc::handle_alloc_error(new_layout),\n        };\n        self.cap = new_cap;\n    }\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\n[Global]: ../../std/alloc/struct.Global.html\n[handle_alloc_error]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html\n[alloc]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.alloc.html\n[realloc]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.realloc.html\n[dealloc]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.dealloc.html\n[std_alloc]: ../../alloc/alloc/index.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::vec-alloc","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"vec-alloc","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["aliasing","arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","panic","undefined_behavior","unsafe","unwinding","vec_abuse"],"title":"Allocating Memory","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"087219708ebae6754d05f39b090ffd4f7499faf34678499ba717873d5af20a6e","sig":"wNrCltU8jf9PZAhIMDL2L2Cam5p7RlZ9xJEpc36GCS9H+EfxUln8zNTW4hi3vh1mfiS+t6IqVKI90XcEjcjnBQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nLet's move on to writing iterators. `iter` and `iter_mut` have already been\nwritten for us thanks to The Magic of Deref. However there's two interesting\niterators that Vec provides that slices can't: `into_iter` and `drain`.\n\nIntoIter consumes the Vec by-value, and can consequently yield its elements\nby-value. In order to enable this, IntoIter needs to take control of Vec's\nallocation.\n\nIntoIter needs to be DoubleEnded as well, to enable reading from both ends.\nReading from the back could just be implemented as calling `pop`, but reading\nfrom the front is harder. We could call `remove(0)` but that would be insanely\nexpensive. Instead we're going to just use ptr::read to copy values out of\neither end of the Vec without mutating the buffer at all.\n\nTo do this we're going to use a very common C idiom for array iteration. We'll\nmake two pointers; one that points to the start of the array, and one that\npoints to one-element past the end. When we want an element from one end, we'll\nread out the value pointed to at that end and move the pointer over by one. When\nthe two pointers are equal, we know we're done.\n\nNote that the order of read and offset are reversed for `next` and `next_back`\nFor `next_back` the pointer is always after the element it wants to read next,\nwhile for `next` the pointer is always at the element it wants to read next.\nTo see why this is, consider the case where every element but one has been\nyielded.\n\nThe array looks like this:\n\n```text\n          S  E\n[X, X, X, O, X, X, X]\n```\n\nIf E pointed directly at the element it wanted to yield next, it would be\nindistinguishable from the case where there are no more elements to yield.\n\nAlthough we don't actually care about it during iteration, we also need to hold\nonto the Vec's allocation information in order to free it once IntoIter is\ndropped.\n\nSo we're going to use the following struct:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\npub struct IntoIter<T> {\n    buf: NonNull<T>,\n    cap: usize,\n    start: *const T,\n    end: *const T,\n}\n```\n\nAnd this is what we end up with for initialization:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> IntoIterator for Vec<T> {\n    type Item = T;\n    type IntoIter = IntoIter<T>;\n    fn into_iter(self) -> IntoIter<T> {\n        // Make sure not to drop Vec since that would free the buffer\n        let vec = ManuallyDrop::new(self);\n\n        // Can't destructure Vec since it's Drop\n        let ptr = vec.ptr;\n        let cap = vec.cap;\n        let len = vec.len;\n\n        IntoIter {\n            buf: ptr,\n            cap,\n            start: ptr.as_ptr(),\n            end: if cap == 0 {\n                // can't offset off this pointer, it's not allocated!\n                ptr.as_ptr()\n            } else {\n                unsafe { ptr.as_ptr().add(len) }\n            },\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's iterating forward:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Iterator for IntoIter<T> {\n    type Item = T;\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n        if self.start == self.end {\n            None\n        } else {\n            unsafe {\n                let result = ptr::read(self.start);\n                self.start = self.start.offset(1);\n                Some(result)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) {\n        let len = (self.end as usize - self.start as usize)\n                  / mem::size_of::<T>();\n        (len, Some(len))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's iterating backwards.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> DoubleEndedIterator for IntoIter<T> {\n    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n        if self.start == self.end {\n            None\n        } else {\n            unsafe {\n                self.end = self.end.offset(-1);\n                Some(ptr::read(self.end))\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBecause IntoIter takes ownership of its allocation, it needs to implement Drop\nto free it.

A Vec has three parts:\na pointer to the allocation, the size of the allocation, and the number of\nelements that have been initialized.\n\nNaively, this means we just want this design:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\npub struct Vec<T> {\n    ptr: *mut T,\n    cap: usize,\n    len: usize,\n}\n```\n\nAnd indeed this would compile. Unfortunately, it would be too strict. The\ncompiler will give us too strict variance. So a `&Vec<&'static str>`\ncouldn't be used where a `&Vec<&'a str>` was expected. See [the chapter\non ownership and lifetimes][ownership] for all the details on variance.\n\nAs we saw in the ownership chapter, the standard library uses `Unique<T>` in place of\n`*mut T` when it has a raw pointer to an allocation that it owns. Unique is unstable,\nso we'd like to not use it if possible, though.\n\nAs a recap, Unique is a wrapper around a raw pointer that declares that:\n\n* We are covariant over `T`\n* We may own a value of type `T` (this is not relevant for our example here, but see \n  [the chapter on PhantomData][phantom-data] on why the real `std::vec::Vec<T>` needs this)\n* We are Send/Sync if `T` is Send/Sync\n* Our pointer is never null (so `Option<Vec<T>>` is null-pointer-optimized)\n\nWe can implement all of the above requirements in stable Rust. To do this, instead\nof using `Unique<T>` we will use [`NonNull<T>`][NonNull], another wrapper around a\nraw pointer, which gives us two of the above properties, namely it is covariant\nover `T` and is declared to never be null. By implementing Send/Sync if `T` is,\nwe get the same results as using `Unique<T>`:\n\n```rust\nuse std::ptr::NonNull;\n\npub struct Vec<T> {\n    ptr: NonNull<T>,\n    cap: usize,\n    len: usize,\n}\n\nunsafe impl<T: Send> Send for Vec<T> {}\nunsafe impl<T: Sync> Sync for Vec<T> {}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\n[ownership]: ../ownership.html\n[phantom-data]: ../phantom-data.md\n[NonNull]: ../../std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::vec-layout","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"vec-layout","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","lifetime_unsoundness","lifetimes","manual_drop","memory_layout","ownership","ownership_hazards","raw_pointer","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Layout","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"699740067d5bfd9f9fdf15b10e75b36110f2a747dfca48e9a2755a9b6fc01298","sig":"N5tEyD3mBNxxWsiYiFI2zqJtETh0ZtWzsgetvwFgypVuPZzKqtIYkfB2VKQGZDHgTkRrdrSoqkFgcv7/SySWDA==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nAlright. We can initialize. We can allocate. Let's actually implement some\nfunctionality! Let's start with `push`. All it needs to do is check if we're\nfull to grow, unconditionally write to the next index, and then increment our\nlength.\n\nTo do the write we have to be careful not to evaluate the memory we want to write\nto. At worst, it's truly uninitialized memory from the allocator. At best it's the\nbits of some old value we popped off. Either way, we can't just index to the memory\nand dereference it, because that will evaluate the memory as a valid instance of\nT. Worse, `foo[idx] = x` will try to call `drop` on the old value of `foo[idx]`!\n\nThe correct way to do this is with `ptr::write`, which just blindly overwrites the\ntarget address with the bits of the value we provide. No evaluation involved.\n\nFor `push`, if the old len (before push was called) is 0, then we want to write\nto the 0th index. So we should offset by the old len.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\npub fn push(&mut self, elem: T) {\n    if self.len == self.cap { self.grow(); }\n\n    unsafe {\n        ptr::write(self.ptr.as_ptr().add(self.len), elem);\n    }\n\n    // Can't fail, we'll OOM first.\n    self.len += 1;\n}\n```\n\nEasy! How about `pop`? Although this time the index we want to access is\ninitialized, Rust won't just let us dereference the location of memory to move\nthe value out, because that would leave the memory uninitialized! For this we\nneed `ptr::read`, which just copies out the bits from the target address and\ninterprets it as a value of type T. This will leave the memory at this address\nlogically uninitialized, even though there is in fact a perfectly good instance\nof T there.\n\nFor `pop`, if the old len is 1, for example, we want to read out of the 0th\nindex. So we should offset by the new len.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\npub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n    if self.len == 0 {\n        None\n    } else {\n        self.len -= 1;\n        unsafe {\n            Some(ptr::read(self.ptr.as_ptr().add(self.len)))\n        }\n    }\n}\n```","flags":["cautionary","do_not_imitate","unsafe_code"],"format":"text/markdown","id":"canon::rust::nomicon::vec-push-pop","links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"section":"vec-push-pop","source":"Rustonomicon","tags":["arc_pitfalls","drop_check","lifetime_unsoundness","manual_drop","memory","memory_layout","ownership_hazards","undefined_behavior","unsafe","vec_abuse"],"title":"Push and Pop","trust_level":"hazardous"},"links":[{"label":"safe_arc_usage","target":"canon::rust::codex::arc"},{"label":"idiomatic_vec","target":"canon::rust::codex::vec_basics"}],"prev":null,"hash":"04013e1d0632a6868851106397f52df952d8f5026bc6384b8f6d18f7b59b8486","sig":"cRo59AUdhyZH7KFAYN5w8AICwlqynXchkaHrKJcS3RoqLYgXcGIr6yMYulK3QFxs9knLdcrflIK6LuhKta6+DQ==","pub_key":"BiPw+ABuDAavThLp4Gly2go7h0GALE/xOOHaCv3LvOs=","witnesses":[]}

Do not use without deep understanding and proper guardrails.\n\nIt's time. We're going to fight the specter that is zero-sized types. Safe Rust\n*never* needs to care about this, but Vec is very intensive on raw pointers and\nraw allocations, which are exactly the two things that care about\nzero-sized types. We need to be careful of two things:\n\n* The raw allocator API has undefined behavior if you pass in 0 for an\n  allocation size.\n* raw pointer offsets are no-ops for zero-sized types, which will break our\n  C-style pointer iterator.\n\nThankfully we abstracted out pointer-iterators and allocating handling into\n`RawValIter` and `RawVec` respectively. How mysteriously convenient.\n\n## Allocating Zero-Sized Types\n\nSo if the allocator API doesn't support zero-sized allocations, what on earth\ndo we store as our allocation? `NonNull::dangling()` of course! Almost every operation\nwith a ZST is a no-op since ZSTs have exactly one value, and therefore no state needs\nto be considered to store or load them. This actually extends to `ptr::read` and\n`ptr::write`: they won't actually look at the pointer at all. As such we never need\nto change the pointer.\n\nNote however that our previous reliance on running out of memory before overflow is\nno longer valid with zero-sized types. We must explicitly guard against capacity\noverflow for zero-sized types.\n\nDue to our current architecture, all this means is writing 3 guards, one in each\nmethod of `RawVec`.\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> RawVec<T> {\n    fn new() -> Self {\n        // This branch should be stripped at compile time.\n        let cap = if mem::size_of::<T>() == 0 { usize::MAX } else { 0 };\n\n        // `NonNull::dangling()` doubles as \"unallocated\" and \"zero-sized allocation\"\n        RawVec {\n            ptr: NonNull::dangling(),\n            cap,\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn grow(&mut self) {\n        // since we set the capacity to usize::MAX when T has size 0,\n        // getting to here necessarily means the Vec is overfull.\n        assert!(mem::size_of::<T>() != 0, \"capacity overflow\");\n\n        let (new_cap, new_layout) = if self.cap == 0 {\n            (1, Layout::array::<T>(1).unwrap())\n        } else {\n            // This can't overflow because we ensure self.cap <= isize::MAX.\n            let new_cap = 2 * self.cap;\n\n            // `Layout::array` checks that the number of bytes is <= usize::MAX,\n            // but this is redundant since old_layout.size() <= isize::MAX,\n            // so the `unwrap` should never fail.\n            let new_layout = Layout::array::<T>(new_cap).unwrap();\n            (new_cap, new_layout)\n        };\n\n        // Ensure that the new allocation doesn't exceed `isize::MAX` bytes.\n        assert!(new_layout.size() <= isize::MAX as usize, \"Allocation too large\");\n\n        let new_ptr = if self.cap == 0 {\n            unsafe { alloc::alloc(new_layout) }\n        } else {\n            let old_layout = Layout::array::<T>(self.cap).unwrap();\n            let old_ptr = self.ptr.as_ptr() as *mut u8;\n            unsafe { alloc::realloc(old_ptr, old_layout, new_layout.size()) }\n        };\n\n        // If allocation fails, `new_ptr` will be null, in which case we abort.\n        self.ptr = match NonNull::new(new_ptr as *mut T) {\n            Some(p) => p,\n            None => alloc::handle_alloc_error(new_layout),\n        };\n        self.cap = new_cap;\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T> Drop for RawVec<T> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        let elem_size = mem::size_of::<T>();\n\n        if self.cap != 0 && elem_size != 0 {\n            unsafe {\n                alloc::dealloc(\n                    self.ptr.as_ptr() as *mut u8,\n                    Layout::array::<T>(self.cap).unwrap(),\n                );\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it. We support pushing and popping zero-sized types now. Our iterators\n(that aren't provided by slice Deref) are still busted, though.\n\n## Iterating Zero-Sized Types\n\nZero-sized offsets are no-ops. This means that our current design will always\ninitialize `start` and `end` as the same value, and our iterators will yield\nnothing. The current solution to this is to cast the pointers to integers,\nincrement, and then cast them back:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> RawValIter<T> {\n    unsafe fn new(slice: &[T]) -> Self {\n        RawValIter {\n            start: slice.as_ptr(),\n            end: if mem::size_of::<T>() == 0 {\n                ((slice.as_ptr() as usize) + slice.len()) as *const _\n            } else if slice.len() == 0 {\n                slice.as_ptr()\n            } else {\n                slice.as_ptr().add(slice.len())\n            },\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we have a different bug. Instead of our iterators not running at all, our\niterators now run *forever*. We need to do the same trick in our iterator impls.\nAlso, our size_hint computation code will divide by 0 for ZSTs. Since we'll\nbasically be treating the two pointers as if they point to bytes, we'll just\nmap size 0 to divide by 1. Here's what `next` will be:\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nfn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n    if self.start == self.end {\n        None\n    } else {\n        unsafe {\n            let result = ptr::read(self.start);\n            self.start = if mem::size_of::<T>() == 0 {\n                (self.start as usize + 1) as *const _\n            } else {\n                self.start.offset(1)\n            };\n            Some(result)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDo you see the \"bug\"? No one else did! The original author only noticed the\nproblem when linking to this page years later. This code is kind of dubious\nbecause abusing the iterator pointers to be *counters* makes them unaligned!\nOur *one job* when using ZSTs is to keep pointers aligned! *forehead slap*\n\nRaw pointers don't need to be aligned at all times, so the basic trick of\nusing pointers as counters is *fine*, but they *should* definitely be aligned\nwhen passed to `ptr::read`! This is *possibly* needless pedantry\nbecause `ptr::read` is a noop for a ZST, but let's be a *little* more\nresponsible and read from `NonNull::dangling` on the ZST path.\n\n(Alternatively you could call `read_unaligned` on the ZST path. Either is fine,\nbecause either way we're making up a value from nothing and it all compiles\nto doing nothing.)\n\n<!-- ignore: simplified code -->\n```rust,ignore\nimpl<T> Iterator for RawValIter<T> {\n    type Item = T;\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n        if self.start == self.end {\n            None\n        } else {\n            unsafe {\n                if mem::size_of::<T>() == 0 {\n                    self.start = (self.start as usize + 1) as *const _;\n                    Some(ptr::read(NonNull::<T>::dangling().as_ptr()))\n                } else {\n                    let old_ptr = self.start;\n                    self.start = self.start.offset(1);\n                    Some(ptr::read(old_ptr))\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) {\n        let elem_size = mem::size_of::<T>();\n        let len = (self.end as usize - self.start as usize)\n                  / if elem_size == 0 { 1 } else { elem_size };\n        (len, Some(len))\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T> DoubleEndedIterator for RawValIter<T> {\n    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<T> {\n        if self.start == self.end {\n            None\n        } else {\n            unsafe {\n                if mem::size_of::<T>() == 0 {\n                    self.end = (self.end as usize - 1) as *const _;\n                    Some(ptr::read(NonNull::<T>::dangling().as_ptr()))\n                } else {\n                    self.end = self.end.offset(-1);\n                    Some(ptr::read(self.end))\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it.

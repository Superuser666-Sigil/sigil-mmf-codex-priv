# MMF-CUL v1.1 – Community Use License

## 1. Purpose
The MMF-CUL governs non-commercial use, extension, and redistribution of Canon-derived content, Codex Module definitions, and interface schemas within the Sigil runtime and Mirage Modular Framework (MMF). This license enables transparent modular system design with ethical, traceable, and open-source alignment.

## 2. Canon and Codex Nexus
All Canon-bound content must adhere to the structure, naming conventions, and reasoning chain requirements defined by the Codex Nexus.
Derivative works may not override Canon without declaring scope, delta, and source hash. Forks must include:

- `sigil_manifest.toml` with:
  - Canon source hash
  - Divergence rationale
  - Module name and author
  - Codex Nexus compatibility tag

## 3. IRL Enforcement
All logic derived from, extended from, or referencing Canon must pass through the IRL (Integrity Reasoning Layer).
If IRL is bypassed, suppressed, or falsified, all rights under this license are revoked.

## 4. Attribution
Any public deployment, publication, or reuse must include:
“Powered by the Sigil Protocol (Rule Zero enforced)”
and a link to either:
- https://github.com/Superuser666-Sigil
- Or the canonical Codex repository fork it derives from

## 5. Derivative Scope and Community Enforcement
This license explicitly grants the right to remix, adapt, or extend for public good—but not to obfuscate trust boundaries.
All community forks must retain:

- Attribution
- Trust boundary logic
- IRL signature enforcement
- Codex-scoped audit trail logic

Non-compliant forks must be labeled “Unofficial / Non-Canonical” and include a visible declaration of Canon departure.

## 6. Commercial Restriction
You may not sell, rent, or license access to any MMF-CUL content unless separately licensed under MMF-CL or other authorized commercial agreements.

## 7. LOA:Founder Authority
In cases of license breach, Canon falsification, or IRL trust subversion, the authority known as LOA:Founder may issue system lockouts or grant restoration.
All actions by LOA:Founder must:
- Be signed with verifiable mnemonic credentials
- Be bound to an IRL justification chain
- Be auditable by LOA:Root upon request

LOA:Founder does not supersede Rule Zero. All Founder actions are enforceable by the same audit standards as any other runtime actor.

## 8. Termination
Violation of the above terms revokes all rights under this license. Restoration may only be granted by LOA:Founder.

Key Generation and Saving Issue Log
==================================

**Summary:**
There is an issue with the Sigil CLI's key generation (`generate-key`) command: when no `--output` parameter is provided, the key is supposed to be saved to a secure directory (e.g., `~/.sigil/keys/` on all platforms). However, the key is not being saved to the secure directory as expected, and no file is created in the current directory either.

**Observed Behavior:**
- The CLI prints the generated public and private key to the console.
- No key file is created in the current directory or in the secure directory (checked on Windows).
- The logic for saving to the secure directory uses `PathBuf` for cross-platform compatibility and calls `save_to_file(&default_path.to_string_lossy())`.
- The `save_to_file` method in `key_manager.rs` writes the file using `fs::write(path, json)`.
- No error is printed, and the CLI reports success, but the file does not appear.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run: `cargo run --bin mmf_sigil -- generate-key --key-id "test-cross-platform" --key-type witness`
2. Observe: No file is created in `~/.sigil/keys/` or the current directory.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The key file should be saved to the secure directory by default if no `--output` is specified.
- The CLI should print the path where the key was saved.

**Relevant Code:**
- `src/cli.rs` (GenerateKey command, path construction with PathBuf)
- `src/key_manager.rs` (save_to_file method)

**Platform:**
- Windows 10 (but should be cross-platform)

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate if the path construction or file writing is failing silently.
- Add debug output to confirm the exact path being used and check for errors.
- Test on Linux/macOS for cross-platform compatibility.

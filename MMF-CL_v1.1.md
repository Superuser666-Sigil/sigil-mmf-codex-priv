# MMF-CL v1.1 â€“ Commercial License

## 1. Purpose
This license grants conditional rights to use, deploy, distribute, and commercialize components of the Sigil Protocol, Codex Nexus, MMF Modules, and the Mirage runtime stack.

## 2. Core Enforcement Requirements
You may not bypass:
- Canon structure
- IRL trust scoring
- LOA enforcement
- Codex audit traceability

All derived systems must retain Reasoning Chain compatibility and provide verifiable runtime outputs.

## 3. Module Commercialization
You may:
- Build and sell MMF Modules
- Offer hosted Sigil-based inference services
- Resell Codex-derived consulting, training, or runtime tools

You must:
- Disclose all Canon sources used
- Declare Canon divergence if applicable
- Retain IRL enforcement if touching any memory or Canon node

## 4. Canonical Identity
If you claim Codex compatibility, your system must:
- Pass IRL enforcement
- Declare its Canon scope
- Include an up-to-date sigil_manifest.toml
- Directly reference and attribute the current runtime at https://github.com/Superuser666-Sigil/sigil-mmf-codex

## 5. Contributor Terms
All contributors must agree to the MMF CLA (Contributor License Agreement).
Minors may only contribute under advisory capacity or with documented guardian approval.

## 6. LOA:Founder Authority
In cases of license breach, Canon falsification, or IRL trust subversion, the authority known as LOA:Founder may issue system lockouts or grant restoration.
All actions by LOA:Founder must:
- Be signed with verifiable mnemonic credentials
- Be bound to an IRL justification chain
- Be auditable by LOA:Root upon request

LOA:Founder does not supersede Rule Zero. All Founder actions are enforceable by the same audit standards as any other runtime actor.

## 7. Termination and Enforcement
Violation of trust scoring logic, Canon integrity, or audit obfuscation results in immediate license termination. Restoration requires LOA:Founder arbitration.

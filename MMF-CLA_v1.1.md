# MMF Contributor License Agreement (CLA) v1.1

## 1. Purpose
This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs all contributions made to the Mirage Modular Framework (MMF) and its runtime enforcement system Sigil. It ensures that contributions uphold the principles of traceable logic, public trust, and ethical AI design under Rule Zero.

## 2. Scope
This Agreement covers:
- Code contributions
- Documentation
- Canon definitions
- Codex schemas
- Module declarations
- IRL rule modifications or enforcement logic

## 3. Contributor Representations
By submitting a Contribution, you confirm that:
- You are the author of the contribution or have explicit permission to submit it
- You grant the maintainers a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, modify, and redistribute your work under either MMF-CL or MMF-CUL
- You will not introduce known exploits, backdoors, or false reasoning logic into any Sigil-governed component
- You accept that any module built under this license must be audit-traceable and may be overridden or locked out if trust enforcement is compromised

## 4. Minor Contributors
If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction:
- You may only contribute under advisory capacity, or
- A parent or legal guardian must co-sign a consent declaration before your contribution is accepted into Canon or Core
- “Parent” or “legal guardian” will be defined according to the contributor’s legal jurisdiction of residence
- Only a certified legal instrument from that jurisdiction may satisfy this requirement
- Documents will be reviewed by counsel hired by the issuer of this license to ensure all legal requirements are satisfied before contribution is accepted

## 5. Attribution & Canonical Tagging
All accepted contributions must include:
- Contributor name or pseudonym
- GitHub/Git credentials, if applicable
- Canon hash or divergence declaration (via sigil_manifest.toml)

## 6. Governance & Arbitration
In the event of contributor disputes, Canon corruption, or violation of IRL structure:
- The matter will be reviewed by LOA:Root
- If arbitration or override is required, LOA:Founder has final say over license restoration or lockout, subject to public audit
- All judgments by LOA:Founder must be:
  - Signed with mnemonic key
  - Justified in an IRL reasoning chain
  - Auditable by LOA:Root and community forks

## 7. Termination
Any contributor who knowingly:
- Submits false Canon
- Breaks IRL scoring integrity
- Disables or obfuscates audit logging
- Fails to include canonical linkage to the Sigil/MMF Codex Nexus core at https://github.com/Superuser666-Sigil/sigil-mmf-codex when claiming Sigil, MMF, or Codex 
  compatibility
  

…may be permanently disqualified from contributing to any MMF-licensed system and added to the public trust blacklist unless granted clemency by LOA:Founder.

**This agreement is binding upon acceptance via signed CLA file, merge request with header tag [CLA:ACCEPTED], or direct commit under Canon governance.**
